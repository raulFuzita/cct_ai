 family mormon have never tried explain them they still stare puzzled from time time like some kind strange creature nonetheless they have come admire for the patience calmness equanimity acceptance and compassion have developed all the things buddhism teaches ,1
buddhism has very much lot compatible with christianity especially considering that sin and suffering are almost the same thing suffering caused wanting things shouldn want going about getting things the wrong way christian this would mean wanting things that don coincide with god will and wanting things that coincide but without the aid jesus buddhism could also seen proof god all mighty will and omnipotence certainly christians are lucky have one such christ there side but what about everyone else well many christians believe god grace salvation and buddhism god way showing grace upon others would also help study the things jesus said and see how buddha has made similar claims such rich man getting into heaven joke basically advocating that should rid ourselves material possessions fact distinctly remembered jesus making someone cry because that someone asked what achieve salvation and jesus replied with live like buddhist very very roughly translated also point out that buddha rarely spoke anything about god theory personally because knew well enough leave that jesus and mohamed who came later just remember conflict difference opinion but education can fun involving and enlightening easier teach something than prove right like intelligent design ,1
seriously don say thing first all they won get its too complex explain normal people anyway and they are dogmatic then doesn matter what you say see mechante post and for any reason you decide later life move from buddhism and that doesn suit you identity though you still get keep all the wisdom then your family will treat you like you went through weird hippy phase for while there didncha and you never hear the end pro tip don put one these your wall jpg ,-1
what you have learned yours and only yours what you want teach different focus the goal not the wrapping paper buddhism can passed others without word about the buddha ,0
for your own benefit you may want read living buddha living christ thich nhat hanh you might find any subsequent discussions with your loved ones easier you are able articulate some the parallels that exist between buddhism and christianity don surprised they react negatively for having lost you treat them with compassion and deserved understanding although they may indeed display signs being hurt your new path properly sharing with them way that may alleviate their fear something they may perceive wrong the very least alien their beliefs may help allowing them the long run accept although not necessarily agree with your decision regardless where they end you have make your own way ,1
you should all sit down together and watch the simpsons episode where lisa becomes buddhist simpsons season episode she little faith then discuss ,-1
 was teens when discovered zen meditation was then undiagnosed bpd being homeschooled and just gotten 56k modem with web connection where came across link zen meditation tried for couple weeks and the change was palpable felt the most profound sense peace ever felt grades immediately started going had more energy started martial arts just huge positive change all around parents asked something was wrong fundie parents when anything changes this was where naiveté kicked foolishly told them been trying meditation and really calmed down thought they happy that found something that helped but never forget what happened next mother affected this mockingly calm breathy voice she said you can pretend calm and happy all you want but without jesus you never content was that moment that any belief had christian faith all vanished completely realized that she had probably never been happy ever have never felt profoundly sorry for someone did for her that moment ,1

there are two varieties christians dogmatic that dwell words and conservative that take heart the spirit the teachings hate oversimplify things but helps this understanding you are discussing with dogmatic religious people who live the letter the law will uphill battle wish you luck you are discussing with moderates exchange idea should come fairly easily comparing contrasting also discussing parallel teachings presented differently wouldn out the ordinary they may give you relevant spiritual advice even though you are not believer their religion ,-1
dont worry about trying explain yourself just meditate regularly and try hard you can more aware everything else will follow coming from someone who has been throught his situation welcome pms ,1
 recently told family that buddhist live the bible belt this whole ordeal involved leaving the baptist church and everything been pretty rough but those who really care about have been open and accepting they seen the good has created life and relationships with others fact there are handful christians who have lovely conversations with and that truly respect someone else suggested living buddha living christ great one read about the important dialogue between buddhists and christians also welcome you message ,1
 unto others you would have them unto you would good start ,1
first understand that you are not anyway control how they will react always find that any subject better understood first learning the vocabulary explain what the word buddha means most people believe buddhists praise worship and follow guy named buddha christians due jesus let them know that one could both buddhist and christian with conflict the teachings and the messages jesus are indeed buddhist philosophy jesus became enlightened buddha and realized that had become annointed being christ then continue with your practice and let them work out their own issues that advice all the best ,1
 recently heard similar question where person asked they should introduce meditation his loved ones who had challenges coping with problems life the answer from the lama was quite interesting instead giving people advice one should focus his practice that way others will see the change and maybe even ask about personally think better keep yourself even though you must really excited about you can also keep dharma books around the house and sure people will pick them for quick browse when you are not looking learn bit about other people traditions well browsing through books they owned ,1
different times different cultures same point they were trying get across jesus said god has beginning nor end buddha said mind was never born and has never died just replace the word meditation with prayer and couting the breath with the name jesus and everyone happy,1

 always liked vecna the one time was able use him story had blast playing the fact that was far not the most powerful deity but was one the most dangerous due his portfolio but favorite pale night who technically not deity but close enough guess most the abyssal lords and the rulers the nine hells are fairly straightforward and have ample backstory but her lack thereof just intriguing ,1
though don have any good suggestions for additional deities the moment you should probably have some overlap the cavern dwelling gnolls might consider pelor the god evil blinding them with his wicked light loki has sufficiently fooled them over the years into thinking their benefactor always leading them the bountiful crops they steal from the peasantry they have statues him fat woman giving out food the starving they view the god death the god justice giving righteous end those gnolls that have served brutal conflicts point view can change everything ,-1
 cliche but you can wrong with cyric mean was mortal who just nabbed all when got the chance you gotta respect that ,-1
zon kuthon and his sister shelyn good deity have really cool story from the pathfinder setting plus off topic pathfinder has the coolest good deity ever cayden cailean was bard that got wasted one night stumbled into the temple the star stone artifact that can turn you into deity and woke the next morning with hangover memory the night before and godly powers ,1
 homebrew setting the primary lawful evil deity named for friend lewie essentially has three domains tyranny law applied without mercy vengeance and community the idea being that cruel and harsh god but also recognizes that you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar thus his church often the most benevolent toward the common people day day basis the running gag that lewian churches sponsor more inner city basketball teams than any other major faith you probably want change the name but might make interesting dynamic within your setting ,-1

 far evil goes big fan shar from the forgotten realms setting the god ultimate despair loss and suffering you know god evil when followers don even bother asking for small boons but instead invoke suffering themselves and others hopes that those events will enough prevent the god from needing get involved personally bringing suffering into the world shar isn one those pansy goddesses evil where you might get nod appreciation for sacrifice with shar you better kill somebody damn near ever day and you get nothing and like with check out the dogma here ,-1
 like the idea prometheus giving magic the pcs however think that prometheus should more like demi god and that the reason why gives the magic mortals prometheus could jealous the fact that the gods have all the powers and they granted him only half status upon his creation thus his revenge giving humanity order turn the tides power among deities and mortals furthermore perhaps the repercussion prometheus feels from his action being dragged the underworld cerberus making him seem less than deity like and more mortal inhuman order face judgment from egyptian goddess morals virtue and judge the dead ,1

zen master bassui said when the functioning analytical consciousness destroyed feelings are purified this referred the pure land the west you truly want know the meaning being born the pure land you must first know the master who born this land the physical body has never from its inception been the true body but rather temporary formation the five aggregates after the four elements disperse what remains called the self the self originally empty what that born the pure land there master born the pure land what that seeks this land bliss just extinguish the ever seeking mind rid thoughts and attachment form and the body consisting the four elements will have individual self when there individual mind the nature mind and there aspect disorder ,1
pure land other power opposed the usual self power taught most buddhist schools though the pure land here and now and not some other dimension the afterlife ,1
there are many flavours buddhism pure land ideas are not common all them however the important thing realize doesn really matter that the big difference compared the abrahamic religions buddhism not dogmatic the sense bunch things that must taken literally else you are non believer sinner whatever maybe pure land ideas work for you great maybe they don great what works for you works for you what doesn work useless you the historical buddha himself taught dramatically different styles suit his audience parables and metaphors are just that the point where they take you not literally believing them literally and physically true zen koans are good example this very purely distilled most are the form stories but not stories you are believe physically happened you are reading history book that entirely irrelevant what the story does you that the point you are wondering did this really happen does this place really exist you are missing that point also worth noting that most things are about psychological phenomenon not physical phenomenon personally find this makes buddhist cosmology much easier understand than considering competitor physical cosmology they not conflict they just about different cosmos ,1
 going try comment this simply can gets metaphysical and some may even say supernatural but hope you can try maintain open mind enough for help with your understanding everything that physical everything that exists the universe and beyond are created the power the mind exercised through consciousness mara created the samsara worlds planes dimensions that may experience joy sadness love heartbreaks etc this was done through his her its focus the mind and streams consciousness began attracted these worlds planes dimensions and begin develop craving for existence and thus begins the cycle rebirth the pure lands buddhism were created the focus the mind amitabha buddha way help individuals attain enlightenment their own pace amitabha buddha understood that the attraction emotions sex love and existence can overwhelming for normal individuals overcome within one lifetime 100 years average for human beings other beings much shorter and yet others much longer created the pure lands the west place refuge and practice for those who call upon his name sincerely this place not metaphorical state mind while these individuals are earth for lack better word real though not necessarily physical the way feel physical things via the electromagnetic repelling force electrons this world certain laws physics are applicable that world land plane dimension whatchamacallit certain laws physics not apply and yet newer laws superphysics would also the rule there that not the law our world now having been carried this land doesn mean that the individuals are guaranteed enlightenment first they still need cultivate themselves while there enlightenment not given dependant every single individual consciousness efforts shed the fetters samsara anger ignorance and jealousy and embrace the noble truths they may choose rejoin the samsaric worlds again and back into the cycle rebirth but least they have the option stay and cultivate themselves the pure land the west that would the main difference between the abrahamic idea heaven against the amitabha buddha pure lands the west hope this helps ,1
 think your characterization pure land isn that far off there reason not that popular among westerners odd abandon christianity judaism and take pure land because first impressions buddhism was that was devoid dogma but now seems much leap faith the abrahamic religions least the pure land sect most forms buddhism have some sort supernatural element some orthodox believers might deny that just like some christians might attempt make scientific arguments for the world being 6000 years old the very least you have rebirth and different planes that includes devas zen seems have the least reverence for dogma which why popular the west the other western strategy assume things are meaningful figuratively and not literally but yeah buddhism religion the end the day for most its followers ,1
most religions have dogmatic orthodox well esoteric philosophic side the christian heaven can seen palace the clouds state mind rebirth buddhism can seen fact just superstition left over from other beliefs you interpret and understand you see fit like think about various religions talking about the same thing using different words and yes cherry pick what believe but honestly and very carefully think better than taking everything religion says and rejecting everything doesn say there must hundred different ways talk about enlightenment heaven pure land individuation alchemy rites passage education trials meditation the tricky part that what describes can easily explained words and most importantly has understood which different than just knowing reading about the pure land real place state mind doubt real place but sure some will believe buddhism has some dogma but not nearly much eastern religions ,1
you won find one answer your question but the pure land state mind perspective reality not separate place let quote thich nhat hanh human beings our deepest desire find environment which secure and where there love and understanding all want live such environment you live surroundings where you feel there security understanding and love and where people have the capacity transform their suffering fear and attachment then you live the pure land from finding our true home this isn leap faith all because you have already been the pure land but momentarily every time you bring the buddha mind fully then you are said the pure land imagine because you enter that state some degree this not matter faith but expanding upon what you know joyful experience quite different the abrahamic religions concept heaven which eschatological reality rather than gnostic one will add that there course are some who believe the pure land totally separate paradise however there are positive ways understanding this when the state mind another rebirth will seem like such foreign reality that may well different place entirely ,1
 first impressions buddhism was that was devoid dogma isn good thing about buddhism least for outsider that much easier pick and choose what parts you not want use see dogma kind environment habitat for the profound and useful ideas develop all religions have something useful buddhist religions and not just one homogeneous buddhism just seem have something that more relevant and powerful the context our culture ,1
from limited knowledge the pure land not paradise but place contemplation stepping off point where you are given the knowledge leave the cycle suffering and rebirth anything more akin the now defunct catholic idea purgatory than actual heaven ,1
 response your question about how amitabha created the pure land this quote from the article pure land buddhism wikipedia the longer sukhāvatīvyūha sūtra the buddha begins describing his attendant ānanda past life the buddha amitābha states that past life amitābha was once king who renounced his kingdom and became bodhisattva monk named dharmākara dharma storehouse under the guidance the buddha lokeśvararāja world sovereign king innumerable buddha lands throughout the ten directions were revealed him after meditating for five eons bodhisattva then made great series vows save all sentient beings and through his great merit created the realm sukhāvatī ultimate bliss this land sukhāvatī would later come known the pure land chinese translation important remember that buddhism has been around for thousands years and that for long time buddhists didn have telescopes big machines scan the brain with his holiness the dalai lama himself has said that the discoveries science and the teachings buddhism contradict then the discoveries science are correct this video tgv1gwvrz one the major teachings the buddha was test out each his teachings oneself order see they were true rather than taking his word faith without proof however course just man who has seen mountain some remote region where one has not traveled may believed until the distance that region crossed might have some sort faith buddhist teachings since the people doing the teachings have often devoted their whole lives the teachings the buddha ,1

the discussion about the rat ended concluding won work because you will naturally headbutt the rat death minotaur might work with another race though trog wrath very very very difficult survive you have boots levitation and lots food you might able hover over lava deep water won help summons giant sized creatures other than that tomb card might work you have your stash food not sure you not using shield you might well switch two handed axe from experience anti magic isn that great with brand fire you can generally kill things faster use holy versus liches and other undead casters and also kill them faster ,1
 could swear they lowered trog wrath just got extremely lucky because recently tried make the switch kobe and was not difficult all just took food ring and some perma food and carved out two space area near the the summons were actually not the worst part the worst got was berserk hill giant and the vast majority were just berserk bears for the worst part was actually the rotting since happened least times and never caught right away while spamming rest,-1
for the love gods don the abyss until trog wrath over none your teleport blink panic buttons work lost handful very promising mibes this way ,1
 when and how supposed swap tso and branch order from there basically you switch immediately before entering crypt clear crypt max tso piety then holy brand your best weapon your case that executioners axe and off you post endgame branch order like whatever theres strict order like there the early game whichever branch you feel best prepared for how avoid meeting terrible fate the hands trog wrath you have book with blink soon you leave trog train transloc little bit that you can cast then whenever surrounds you with berserking enemies you can blink out the middle them and run staircase teleport you can keep scrolls blinking hand for this purpose but feel more secure also having the spell trog wrath includes fire miscasts that burn all your shit see trick with going lair and having rat block you off but this still viable you can the rat shield thing with most combos but its tedious and unnecessary and your case the minotaur retaliatory headbutt would kill the rat anyway its not option antimagic axe that carry around viable for use all since strictly one handed should train shields use with since have shield reflection could use not really war axes arent very good and while has fantastic selection resists does little damage that its not practical choice weapon against any tough monster wouldnt forgo the damage output weapon use physical shield shields arent very good for melee allruners and therse always tsos divine shield ability you want reflection isnt good shield brand plus its double not good for tso worshiper you reflect poison projectile and hits something you will incur penance for use poison ,1
 brother trog very wrathful indeed but his will destroy you neither endless nor inevitable going take the route many will find the easy way out and say that getting past trog your level trivial his wrath dangerous out the open but when you are able choose the area diluted mere timesink what you must grab your closest disintegration wand and cut two diagnols into the wall this will allow you only view one other tile time this point you simply need make sure you have good chunks permafood pip two and then either drop your scrolls wear conservation that point you just spam rest and then tab every time trog has tantrum minotaur your power should have trouble killing his summons after long while you will get message saying has calmed down then you are free worship that damned tso trog wrath your level probably one the least dangerous things you can spend your time dealing with you are willing cheese ,1
 were you slime zot except for the orb chamber and blade hopefully you find some better armour you really want good executioner axe before you convert well the okay but could better you really need wearing plate gda something heavier you have more than abandoned trog with level mibe and found pretty trivial the berserked stone giants weren terribly difficult and cleared tomb and most all hells while under trog wrath but somewhat wary trying this with your low and weak weapon you could try waiting out but takes thousands and thousands turns very boring one handed axes suck use executioner axe ,1
 have currently rune mibe right now and abandoned trog then immediately cleared crypt max piety and enchant executioner axe then threw caution the winds and cleared pan and hells while under trog wrath was tricky but doable make sure you have curing potions that time was strong enough take out trog summons all sides problem worked but could have died with worse luck ,1
 your stage you should strong enough take the berserk summons have the resources escape out them retreat corridor and take them one one quaff curing heal rot would also recommend you get plate armour better asap for the and guaranteed damage reduction also wield the biggest axes you can find kill things faster ,1
 you max armour dodging and shields for tso divine shield then the berserkers are joke can wipe them even when fully surrounded and only lose health even with armour and dodging they won give you much trouble ,-1
ewwww why are you using broad axe get real weapon bet trog gave you good battleaxe exec axe something splint get plate armour better trog wrath will completely destroy char with such poor defenses ,1

nonsense who claimed that the panacea for all evils will turn india into supapowaaa 2015 find one poster who claimed such here almost everyone acknowledges that the best atleast one the best amongst the current available lot and can provide governance that will atleast better relative the current upa regime ,1
yes won solve all the problems overnight but strong leader with plan still better than idiots with plan case study obama people expected the economy fixed the thursday after was elected and course that didn happen still fairly shit and most the issues that were big deal 2009 are still pertaining but still did manage eliminated subsidies private lender middlemen student loans and protect student borrowers healthcare reforms for tens millions americans expanded hate crime law the include sexual orientation appointed nations first chief technology officer signed financial reform law establishing consumer financial protection bureau signed financial reform law prohibiting banks from engaging proprietary trading are these irrelevant and pointless they aren hasn lifted america out the sewer but empowered students women consumers medical patients etc that they can achieve their potential without shit like insurance and loans get their way thus bringing back point the change you wantt see etc etc and that what believe modi can the change for the country must come from the grass roots easier said than done not like have deal with lapse enforement laws corruption red tape logistics etc you can call modi bots but think the alternatives double failure mms rahul gandhi digvijay chiddu what has the congress done besides spoonfeed the backward zombies and keep them backward ,-1
please change the title wretched country where its news sold appease the ruling party wretched country where terrorism sickularism maoism separatism tolerated wretched country whose leaders appease community the name religion and caste wretched country where its leaders are involved corruption scams rape money laundering tax evasion etc not saying namo will solve all problems but atleast will not remain mute and deaf like manmohan singh who does not even give interviews about his governance atleast namo speaks good bad about his state manmohan singh does not not even speak about the country just lapdog sonia gandhi ,1
and even more wretched the country that can depend even one man there have been people throughout history who were pivotal figures gandhi and lincoln are two examples have seen modi handle his charge that gujarat superbly contrast have seen politicians who are inept and corrupt led the congress which can sell out the country for example pitting against cbi and having suggestions surface that pakistan sponsored attack admitted pakistan was inside job yes bank the man hope nothing happens him because our opinion party that capable compromising india interests vis vis pakistan capable killing someone well ,1

amartya sen says “ indian citizen don’ want modi has not done enough make minorities feel safe ” said being asked why did not want sen said “ could have first all been more secular and could have made the minority community feel more secure ” indian demographics are not uniformly distributed muslim and the rest hindu all over the country there are cities and towns where muslims and christians are majority very large minority yet come across even single town that integrated that where the two communities live together there are hindus who live muslim and christian majority townships who are very much minorities and they are not faring well all just sad and bewildering that economists the stature sen can not see the plight hindu minorities hindu majority country the word secular has been reduced slogan that now means being overly solicitous obscurantist elements the muslim leadership while ignoring the plight all other minorities the traditional sense the word what non secular thing has modi done has introduced madrassas hindu schooling has made some religious rules conduct for women forcing muslims wear some marker distinguish them from the rest the people has gone and interfered with the running their institutions had sen spent more time india would have known the answers these questions and also why secularism has become such hated word the majority indians don’ want situation where the minority feel insecure and could legitimately think that there was organised violence against them 2002 think that terrible record and don’ think indian prime minister indian citizen who has that kind record not narsimha rao was the home minister during the 1984 delhi riots which are better example state sponsored riots than any other indian history when least 3000 sikhs were murdered mob violence delhi alone home minister rao was directly responsible for ordering the delhi police delhi was union territory then stand aside the sikhs were murdered their neighborhoods when rao was elevated being the sen kept his counsel not bring the sikh riots justify the godhra riots but only point out the hypocrisy people using all their lungs scream about gujarat but are silent about all other incidents violence modi could have made the majority community feel that they are not maltreating the minority and going against the long indian tradition being tolerant indians have been tolerant things for far too long are tolerant sewage our drinking water poison our food rape our streets loot our leaders war and murder our neighbors have lost half our country and have been ethnically cleansed wherever are not majority are tired being tolerant and most all are tired interminable lectures well meaning academics how should run our affairs and what can and can not think please sen let ,1

looking modi from outside seems similar popularity what obama was here when was running for elections both seem different from rest the field both attract huge number followers ideas both are fresh and both give people their countries hope that previous politicians had all but removed obama good president opinion but isnt good was saying will and that probably because political restraints under expect the same happen with modi seems have done lot good for gujarat but not sure can that level good for entire india both obama and modi are very eloquent orators ,1
 really have high hopes this man have never seen public demanding man made ,1

 big fan either modi bjp but what says here what would want politicians say more often rather than saying things like any person gets angry after seeing injustice meted out family affected this then cannot held guilty bihar beti etc attempt appease any particular religion infuriates extent that people are ready castigate modi for innocuous somewhat misguided puppy analogy and then don acknowledge him when makes sense this the thing about really polarizing india people either love him immensely despise him completely very few people the middle ,1

modi the leader the indian neo nazi party bjp most the people who support him are skinheads who call for extermination muslims resorts appeasement neo nazis for more info about fuhrer here documentary about the modern day hitler modi and his policies c0zvadtrdpm also the ministers under him have been sentenced for inciting the riots like this woman and this guy ,1
 modi divisive figure people like call him you will get strong opinions from both sides and zero facts the same time the principle political opponent the nehru gandhi family with strong dynasty influence inc unifying figure where there global agreement that they are themselves highly corrupt and shelter the corrupt and the sole purpose they serve that indian national congress party would disintegrate the absence sycophancy some people strongly believe that having dumbass with zero track record experience governance much more preferable compared someone who may may not been responsible for sheltering the rioters each their own ,1
tell many people you can vote for modi this govt has destroyed the country economy there development there law and order most important all not able protect the country from muslim jihadis who are trying kill many possible ,1
lets say modi has attributes abcxyz people who like him like him for abcx people who don like him and despise him lot for cxyz that people who like him like him for different reasons than the reasons for which people hate him this why the whole confusion and cacophony opinions when person who trying understand the landscape modi has huge popularity among nris and india which don really understand why his abc characteristics for which liked much his supporters are his economic and growth policies and his pro hindutva ala pat robertson bill reilly style christian conservatism political stance his xyz characteristics for which hated much his opponents his association with gujarat riots during 2002 his state suffered through terrible riots between hindus and muslims triggered train full hindu pilgrims allegedly burned muslim mob resulted state wide backlash against muslims and about 1000 muslims died and many many more were displaced india has had his own share riots and usually the ruling leaders aren blamed much but narendra modi hated much because came television and sympathized with the hindu rioters addition there were reports him letting happen despite the controversy over the years modi has enjoyed widespread support his state and won many elections terms personality wise outspoken and has all the leaderish not leadership qualities indians desire their leader this year election could quite like 2012 american election where lot more people voted against mitt romney and republicans rather than voted for obama although congress government isn popular bjp runs with polarizing figure like modi then there will people flocking congress government but this does not predict the outcome the election hope that helps ,1
 been following reddit for while mainly because how entertaining and sometimes informative the comments various issues are been thinking joining for while and bit the bullet after seeing this thread what has modi done candidate what the gujarat story his many enemies will typically quote various statistics show his state poor light but the problem with statistics they can quoted out context reach the conclusion you want according your agenda gujarat means the most developed state india and does indeed lag behind many social indicators but the fact was doing far worse most these child malnutrition before modi became and speaking indicators rarely will your see article highlighting that gujarat contributes percent india industrial output and percent its exports gujarat has the lowest unemployment rate for indian state and accounts for percent new job creation gujarat has 100 percent rural electrification with power supply over 000 villages which has been boon not only for small scale industries but also farmers gujarat has agricultural sector growth percent against the national average percent gujarat known for great road network connecting the above 000 villages well well managed public transportation system gujarat known for relatively low corruption levels and higher efficiency police and government this has been helped governance and policing initiatives general getting things done much faster gujarat than the average for indian governments tata got its nano plant approved matter days rather than months years complaints about roads infrastructure etc are generally dealt with quickly there more but this should for start and typing out this much gleaned from various online and gujarati sources some reddit itself afraid already established myself moditard and will probably the immediate target all manner criticism ,1
truth told there not insignificant percentage the middle class who are willing vote for modi order avoid voting for congress corruption rahul gandhi but the modi tards are not making this easy decision should ,1

shortest answer that the ruling party the left side the political spectrum and has gone over the top appeasing poor people different religions and distributing free stuff modi leans the right and more free market kind guy and believes more the western sense secularism and wants uniform civil code one big blot his career which the opposition milking like desparados the 2002 riot during which happened the gujarat that another variable the equation ,1
 you come the wrong place ask about modi this place full ultra right wing hindu neonazis asking here about modi like asking westboro baptist church about religious tolerance you should probably read about him online from independent media sources ,1

not india such but conversations with north east friends who tell about the horrors congress rule refugees appeasement and that didn sit down well with regarding bjp was pro bjp during vajapayee but 2003 obviously helped shake that confidence only after years kind figured that there deeper game play looking the amount propoganda newspapers went voice their hate against modi wasn just right and yeah sickularism have had talk with folks who have problem with modi and they are entitled their opinion some the information they have which they use build their opinion selective and flawed but then some the information know might well flawed too everything war now are age information warfare more the information more tough shove away the and know the truth the human mind can only take much ,-1
" before used anti rss result anti bjp very skeptical towards aap thought jlp bill was silly drama used lean lot towards left but was not impressed their presence national stage thought other 3rd front parties are over ambitious clowns supported congress they appeared the best available option they are definitely not perfect but better than other options however must admit like most their purported aam admi initiatives you know the which will feed lazy people now still dislike rss vhp their ideology bjp fan boys their rabid bigotry scares don think modi evil too but very skeptical that would able control his masters fans sangha parviar cronies aap not bad very impressed how transparent they have kept their finances for that reason alone wish they will win elections delhi nothing has changed about left other 3rd front but then again you barely hear about them online anyway things seem would still with inc the best available option for the lok sabha

 from gujarat have seen the transformation with own eyes give you example when started college ahmedabad 2004 the moment step out from the kalupur railway station eyes used burn due pollution the simple solution that converting petrol autos cng autos modi implemented that policy converting all petrol autos cng autos gave them deadline and incentive and assistance from the govt make that transition the time was 2006 could really see the difference harassment veteran auto wallahs nothing just plain education and assistance which resulted prompt compliance the riverfront wow explanation required guess rurally the roads that connected remote villages have drastically improved and has the journey time and the journey itself have lived entire life gujarat and have seen and felt the transformation also the internet and electricity claims that modi bjp make are true native place remote village northern gujarat and have seen that improvement facilities good metro grandparents place has grand plans and implements them well even the much lauded gujarat tourism true and not hoax have heard several praises from elder tourists from southern india who have opted for the gujarat tourism trips there can many more examples but long story short knows how make the best from the available resources and has definitely changed and improved gujarat ,1

 tell people from gujarat people who been there what gujarat like just like any other good state india good urban centres and average poor rural areas are there broken roads there yes you people get clean drinking water and other facilities yes and people have access drinking water their premises according planning commission data 2011 clean drinking water treated drinking water like anywhere india completely like the usa terms infrastructure and civic amenities lol there still miles before you even remotely touch that level ,1
 been ahmedabad gandhinagar sometime 2005 and the roads there are high quality and they must the usual counter call this that capital city they take more care roads are automatically renewed etc live hyderabad and proof otherwise also like madhu kishwar wrote her manushi blog people have peaceful and safe social outing even after 10pm etc which relatively unthinkable hyderabad the cops themselves might give people washing and send home ,1
not much they would like you believe but still one the best states india live there are broken roads there still poverty lack clean drinking water issue the people are really friendly and nice fun state and the prohibition alcohol has done wonders the civic life have been gujarat for over years now and have loved every moment except for the fact that isn very accommodating meat lovers come and visit the state sometime the gir national park rann kutch especially during the rannmahotsav daman and diu somnath and many other places visit ,1

yeah dude its completely fab here pic jpg village gujarat more pics the news ece ,1
you will get comments from fanboys and haters neither them will objective search google read few articles compare indicators development with other states and then you will get the full picture ,1
from someone who has been gujarat while travelling various places some years back still remember the clean lane highways windmills everywhere the both sides the roads and the scenic beauty top that development total coherence with nature preservation was just small naive boy then though your dismay and mine those windmills and solar cell arrays are still hold rajasthan iirc the state things hopeless with the increasing thefts inox wind 150 crore the authorities don give fuck except looking for their cut and the private companies say they can install the machinery with these thefts going and its 2013 now compare that with gujarat also someone can confirm have heard from friends that any govt official doesn see your queries complaints within specific period time you can directly approach the modi its that simple try contacting mayawati ,1
yes has used live vastrapur which was considered lower middle class middle class area the vastrapur lake was developed front eyes changing the entire socio economic fabric that place within years also the will second rbecks visited friends village very small blink and you miss place near himmatnagar and the roads were lanes speaking people the village they told because the roads they could get their produce the cities themselves instead hiring 3rd party transporters have stayed many cities over life time delhi mumbai bangalore gujarat and comparing them all over one life time the changes are surprisingly drastic and saying that development happening all over india does not cut majority this development happening urban areas only but gujarat you can see happening both urban and rural areas,1

the clearly sarcastic and malignant posting this obviously very modest and holier than thou aap supporter ,1
 not all there reason why modi known feku popularly everywhere now doubt has done some good work gujarat but that only from more marketing perspective rather then any good value the people kankariya lake ahemdabad very well known face changed now completely looks like any international location but now common man cant there why because entry fee kankaria lake inr know inr not big deal but once lake which was open public now costing inr just enter highways and roads connecting village best but roads villages and cities are having tons holes industrialization has gone crazy there regulation come from kutch and have seen things really mad there terms pollution there proper guideline implemented terms what should height chimney mills chimney mills are low that when you even walk your home your feet will get black pollution villages are unbearable villages still runs most public transport not petrol diesel but fucking kerosene education definitely improving but you wont see much difference compared years consumption tobacco would highest gujarat gujarat govt corrupt like any other state govt company was bidding for project gujarat were told pay lacs for tender and tender will your favour but still cant give guarantee tomorrow someone else comes with better amount will ditch you your face narmada damn very good example modi doing good work really great work its benefits are tremendous but the way modi portraying progress gujarat just cream but ground reality worst then you can imagine ,1

 don count congress out yet they may form government delhi tomorrow will know how much social media impacts elections bjp didn had strong candidate delhi despite aap bjp gets majority will think that only because modi regardless that modi has very tough road ahead congress looses delhi and other states will see very nasty campaign 2014 would love see how muslim majority government employee majority and rich upper middle class area vote share and comparison with 2008 one gets majority who you think aap will support aap will take support from form government ,-1
well the guys below the original active participation politics started with development agenda modi and iac movement regarding this anti corruption middle class etc this aap party not the first india happened earlier during jayaprakash narayan era and his chela mulayam singh was arvind kejriwal that time the second time happened during singh era its simply matter time and enjoy how history repeats ,1
the very fact that the delhi elections are discussed india far more often than the elections the other states indicates that aap having great impact democracy india were not for aap vast majority would not care about these elections the major political parties india have always been cahoots and indian elections have had almost impact the lives most its citizens regardless how many seats aap wins hope all realize that this the first time grassroots organization built volunteers and without any kind corporate backing can have great impact indian elections ,1

what were the other policies you discussed not asking for details you gave above just bullet points thx ,-1
 thought would not understand policy discussions but what you have listed simple good way summarize increase oil production guess that should easy since saw recently that leaders all parties unanimously support this initiative for nominal amount really need this for inclusive development but guess this would need the support state governments too have really retarded regional parties ruling promising states congress has totally failed this aspect hope bjp could turn things around definitely agree especially are way behind electronics market many semiconductor companies have huge non manufacturing sites here iirc intel was supposed usher semiconductor manufacturing early 2005 and they pulled out because these lethargic policy makers not beat dead horse but wish bjp and all parties become serious tackling the silent corruption government especially the regulatory and enforcement boards like law and order environment water totally screwed one family members high ranking official one such board doesn matter which government has been transferred incessantly recently got transferred when got into tussle with opposition party mla industry and the ruling party minister summoned him next week and handed the transfer and top all not even honest does the least that could and that follows court orders god bless the honest officers hope this would change maybe the political discourse that happening among people nowadays will change ,1
nice know that thank you ,1
its because bjp wants such rules place and its better get done under congress they won get blamed that way ,1
" india has been ruined congress and populist schemes the problem with populist schemes that you can make noise you are opposition you instantly branded anti poor another problems once introduced not easy get rid them aap with share leftists and socialist like prashant bhushan yogendra yadav binayak sen etc are more towards congress ideology with added agenda anti corruption compared bjp want see some pro market reforms which will create jobs and get our country
back growth rate another problem have the minority appeasement meeting tauqueer raza and then going defend him aap doing the same things
that congress did third holier than thou attitude they just don accept that there are good non corrupt people all parties lot people from
congress and bjp joined aap and suddenly became non corrupt while they were corrupt their old parties don hate aap don like their ideology and attitude would even vote there was option aap like party with right leaning
economic ideology afaik loksatta one such party but even though stay hyd don have vote here have vote native state ",-1
long rant from aap supporter answers for all your questions you think that aap the only honest party and arvind some kind messiah arvind says that gadkari corrrupt that you will start running around with pitchforks and torches but ignore the news when gadkari proven innocent arvind says that bjp congress you aaptards being intellectually lazy will just accept gospel truth without asking why are raman singh jaitley shivraj vasundhra modi goa corrupt infact they are some the most honest intelligent and progress driven politicians india since very long time unlike aap bjp actually takes action against part members who act retarded case point jethmalani jaswant reddy kesubhai and many others compare that aap one founding members bhushan hardcore anti nationalist shazia caught accepting bribes even before election action against them defectors are given tickets arvind himself plays mulla appeasing policies numerous times aap just bunch idealist lefties who keep shouting the loudest that all politicians are thieves people being stupid accept the generalising statement and convert aaptards without checking the truth still don necessarily hate aap just think that bjp much better option also that most aap fanbois are just fanbois who can think thing themselves added later also point about aap fans being retards proven the downvote campaign which the resident aaptards downvote all comments after every such post proves point that aaptards are just bunch intellectually empty fanbois even the seems naive with his silly questions ,1
every question yours loaded how you expect objective discussion ,0
because aapturds eat poop then they poop and they use write false promises that why they are called aapturds,-1
did you adopt the karl rove strategy making questions that will give the responses you want parks and recreation reference for those trying figure out for the record don support any the parties mentioned here for indian politics has come choosing between the lesser evils ,0
 politics part the unholy duo religion politics which brings out some the most emotional and impassioned read holds barred slug flamewars the web expect people argue beyond region and logic ,1
 have said time and again most people arent shallow minded like the aaptards think vote single agendas agendas which they know unrealistic and just are plain rhetoric dont blame for not having the tunnel vision that you lot are afflicted with corruption does not mean effective governance rather live corrupt nation but one that provides relatively better governance than honest state that just stagnates you didnt understand what said the previous para that exactly the problem with aaptards and you need expand your political perspective ,1
aap the new congress congress issues certificates secularism aap issues honesty anybody who comes from any party and joins congress becomes insta secular similarly all the odd mlas who went from bjp cong aap because they were rejects their own party have become insta honest way just like cong the gangotri indian secularism aap the yamnotri honesty ,1
thanks for proving once again that aap supporters are bunch immature bholas having deep rooted casteist and communal views this why easy for congress make fools out you they split their opposition vote and made delhi ungovernable and you stupids fell for their game plan and still haven wisened hahahahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa troll ,1
problem with aap they are like worker union leaders sure they have honest intentions but then again not sure good union leaders would make good mds maybe wrong here but how much will ways aap survive reality still unknown even maharashtra prithviraj chavan was almost forced resign when exposed ajit pawars corruption even helpless what can you expect from others corruption like vicious network intertwined and ingrained into indian society should focus changing society unlike aap dudes who think bringing some law going improve things practically speaking bjp right choice about aap nothing can said how can perform national level ,1
all those who wonder why would prefer bjp over aap for them just for starters these policies link here ,0
 suspicious all politicians but simply cannot trust and accept anyone that has problems holding democracy hostage both and that hazare hack are guilty ,-1
thanks lot for the insight can easily relate point for example was never interested knowing something like katch but with superb promotion the gujrat tourism has certainly caught family attention and now features the visit locations for any idea how they would tackle the population increase problem india since may root cause many issues poverty level inflation essential commodity depleting forming land ,1
 don know what kind post you are reading rindia there are many many aap supporters here many posts aap supporters even mod aap supporter ,1
 good that has already started his policy hope gets one chance the top job about years yes policy decisions take time bear fruits upa1 actually enjoyed the benefits policies nda look upa2 see how they actually perform ,1
india also needs test the new nuke designs hope that pokhran gets test some newer and lighter mirv designs for our new missiles soon ,1
great appreciate your efforts and this healthy way debate and criticise opponents not the kind which involves baseless lies rumors and team foreign funding crap tired those now which for some reason bjp followers think more effectice don know who told them that because only pisses off and more damage than good bjp itself and since you mentioned your post and made clear our discussion that corruption the issue for will track this post and engage ina discussion once you address that point because matter what good policy you come with unless you can implement the ground they mean nothing and this why before anything want corruption addressed share with how modi planning fight corruption ,1
 hate aap for the other thread points such the routine flip plops appeasement ology positions stated about batla house etc this particularly because aap proclaims basic that others are not sum aap self advertised image and platform their commentary why they have not yet perform nothing about ,-1
 this will restrict migration this will definitely strike chord with mumbaikars hope they articulate this well the upcoming rally ,0

 perhaps they fear they may lose small fraction voter base they either support oppose hopefully they will come with their views soon what think the problem that many individual party members may have personal opinion but they don want say anything against the party lines this just personal view party traditionally with right center views and the fact that they are mum about the supreme court having reverted the decision made the delhi high court fear they agree with but hope they take stance soon not having opinion all the worst stance for any political party especially issues relating human rights 377 homosexuality any other especially when party has strong candidate running for ,-1
 critical issue nice priorities bro for the record fully endorse the repealing the archaic law which needlessly protrudes into the bedrooms consenting adults but dont get carried away except tiny tiny minority urban centers one gives shit this issue ,-1
 the only problem will take years show its effects society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit ” the fact that the bjp manifesto which honestly could just bunch populist bullshit promotes long range initiatives reason itself optimistic about bjp led future years isn that long reality but the mind indian politician parliament election cycles ,1
 really have very little issue with bjp economic policies think they have the clearest agenda among big parties more concerned with the social aspects their agenda they also are doing terrible job the opposition and are known pretty corrupt ,-1
 like bjp should put this their manifestos anyway least the middle class and the business community will find attractive please continue you have more one suggestion read trade magazine some time ago about how employees maruti factory were striking for wages the tune whopping lakh illustrated how our labor laws had driven salaries unsustainably high many manufacturing sectors and stymied india efforts become manufacturing hub how even bangladesh was having more success than this regard fact this why many indian manufacturers seem hire disproportionately high percentage contract labourers work their factories they don have pay them the same high rates from this would say labor reform and reducing the power unions something else that needs considered the hidden policies that are wait ,1
 really hope focuses more rooftop solar ece like germany not just gujarat but the entire country much good skip hydrocarbon and straightaway adopt renewables that will have adopt anyways the future ,1
well who actually reads the manifesto ,0
why should bjp say anything there law has amended scrapped the government can introduce the new law parliament and depending the new law bjp can choose support not the problem posted the other thread day back most people are misunderstanding that the article 377 against homosexuals covers wide range issues and the foundation for other laws also makes lot heterosexual acts unlawful including general terms blowjob and anal sex you read and understand the entirety the law then you will understand that doesn mention homosexuals and applied against them should the law scrapped sure but before that see that since this the only law that covers sodomy guess india will also need laws covering rape male female another male also not sure the new rape laws 2013 protect male child not coz they not then this the only law per understanding which can use punish the criminal law not against homosexuals applied against them can applied against heterosexuals also scrap but create new laws first replace this law someone from the legal fraternity can ama and answer our questions about article 377 and rape abuse laws india will great clearing the misinformation ,1
politically would stupid move take stand right before the elections maybe that the reason,-1
 would like bjp come out support scrapping sec 377 but won expect them make comment this because there are lot religious organizations which are against scrapping 377 and support bjp there might loss support bjp takes stance this close national elections might not work well bjp does not have presence many states would not like alienate whatever support has other parts meenakshi lekhi pointed out her tweets this ruling doesn make any difference the act between consenting adults neither them will file fir police won come checking around your bedroom see what you are upto just that will illegal act eyes law congress the other hand has come support scrapping this law openly this spite asg arguing for the law guess congress knows won forming the next government any stand takes issues won hurt them much ,-1
the government should have say what goes between two consenting adults room period why the hell are you bothered about his stance lgbt rights just because that moron sanjay jha raised the issue ,-1
politics 101 country that medieval minded the one hand and seeks 21st century capitalistic interests the other ,-1
let put forward some problems and issues the first problem solved define sodomy and what acts are included presently blowjobs anal sex etc are illegal for everyone the major question arises whether allow fucking the assholes yes then should allowed just between homosexual interactions among heterosexual ones well lesbians having sex fine until they are not really penetrating anything you would wonder then how could called sex but they wish use sex toys for the same they are not allowed owning selling producing sex toys banned india sex toys are allowed india again the question arises should allowed just between homosexual interactions among heterosexual ones well even the act sex needs defined the present definition wont stand the point does not affect single law affects plenty laws commenting the issue would mean lot things and believe unless someone has clear idea what other effects that might have the existing laws she should refrain from commenting its good supporting opposing something but doing without knowledge inappropriate ,1
critical issue lol one cares ,1
this would issue these people were prosecuted under 377 and thrown jail tbn and9gctljwbsdyreogwxjxqaeakwn eauxr95fn6ylsdimxltrmsi3lh jpg jpg pride15 jpg agree that the article joke which also criminalizes heterosexual oral anal sex however practice person only charged one the individual not adult the act committed without consent yeah archaic law that needs but doesn harm anybody hence political party stance the issue irrelevant ,-1

congress supporters not hate aap aap looks like better congress them bjp supporters are worried that straight contest between bjp and congress which they expected win easily has become possibly three cornered contest and the fence sitters non bjp voters angry cong have switched their loyalties aap instead bjp this not good thing their view and they will attack aap discourage these new supporters aap aap looks too impractical some and distraction they believe that replacing cong with bjp the practical answer ,1
everyone hates corruption stop being high minded about maybe just cynic but not hate aap just think they are naive and simplistic just elucidating against the problems with their solutions being untenable also not simple problem stop bucketing all there the harmful top down institutional which bad but the bottom corruption actually not bad here papaer pdf link pdf the relevant portion from abstract the whole paper interesting find that bad corruption corruption which asso ciated with poor institutions has negative effect gdp growth however residual corruption corruption which uncorrelated with other governance characteristics positively related gdp growth countries with poor institutions why this because have dual economy and bad institutions and cannot pay the lower level government officials enough and they cannot participate the black economy cannot and should not change that overnight fighting the political corruption sure should but not know any voter who for please get off your high horse not like any the parties india but there nothing more dangerous than high minded sanctimonious ideologues who sneer others change comes with the stronger institutions nothing aap proposes actually does that someone disagrees please point that policy ,-1
 why most you here india hate aap are you corrupt mind have you benefited through corruption you blindly support some other party you support some party because your caste religion brahmins bjp and muslims congress you don believe corruption can eradicated indian politics all these questions and you still ask why aap fans are the reason that people here have started hating that party anyone according you who doesn support aap all those keep your honesty with your self thanks another week with you guys and will really start hating aap ,-1

 reason that they complain too much they come with too much terms and conditions too many ifs and thens they dont analyze situation and have readymade answer removing corruption for every problem ,1
 hate aap let now answer your questions not really but when have deal corrupt minds myself turn into one not have enough time remain saint with corrupt minds and fight with them till they change would like work done they understand the language corrupt mind will become one not till now have logic behind supporting other party support namo and bjp have seen his work years have seen the result have seen the change have seen others appreciating his work including national and international governments basically everyone has verified some way that suitable take the national further through development name one single leader entire india who has got much appreciation through both national and international governments him the first ranker politics right now supporting him support bjp because want progress and development there other party india that has much clear vision bjp and namo does corruption can eradicated politics not something experimented aap the only party that focuses only corruption nothing else but their agenda ideology has real base real proof what they say true and can done then they should become part government delhi and provide sample and ways right now they not know how nor have they tried before nor they want become part government hope this answers ,-1
from another thread want ask how can someone who will purportedly run clean political party start his career with lies committing character assassinations honest people and not apologizing when the accusations not amount anything then there the matter persistent muslim appeasement style politics claiming batla house encounter was fake then when people tried pin him down doing volte face and saying that agreed with the court judgement the point note that the judgement had been out for months when the offending aap pamphlet came out approaching the muslim electorate not citizens but flock who can pimped out sundry maulanas like taqeer raza taqeer raza has been indicted for giving out fatwa behead tasleema nasreen yet when asked kejri brazened out saying let someone produce proof that taqeer raza issued fatwa when there are cases against him running courts for this very thing also the volte faces are far too frequent some gent writing for indian exponent criticized economic vision document aap website link below today that document gone from aap website there stand that aap will not give will not play well the mediia what can trust them for aam aadmi party aap economic vision been disappointment far html then there are previous baseless allegations aap went town claiming that bjp candidates have criminal cases against them when the reality that almost all cases are for crimes like unlawful assembly these are the exact kind cases that kejriwal and many aap candidates themselves are facing given that bjp was the principal opposition the capital for the past years its natural that most such cases for public protests will against the bjp candidates how can you trust the allegations coming out his mouth when willing indulge such cheap tactics please dont think that saying these things bjp supporter was vocal supporter the iac movement going the extent taking half day leave and joining protest the now feel cheated that kejriwal has used the support well meaning people like launch himself career active politics which neither intellectually nor ethically equipped handle any case not trying tell you whom support but former iac supporter want say that dont find aap politics any different from any other political party ,1
 you have provided options aap haters per your tiny winy kuchhi pucchi chhotu motu understanding indian politics with all due respect may ask for provision nota ,-1
" like aap for its stand corruption and making people aware about their civic duties and mobilizing youth take part active politics hate aap for its communist ideology public appeasement policies minority appeasement which are not very different from congress and for its arrogant and holier than thou attitude
they have build party showing negative points others its high time they show good governance forming government delhi and prove themselves fulfilling tall claims they have made ",-1
 are you corrupt mind have you benefited through corruption you blindly support some other party think this illustrates why people hate the followers aap with vengeance much fucking smug stupid that they can power thousand suns which have died down and turned into barren stars edit also this thread posted nri muslim nri muslim lethal combo ,-1
and let not forget most the aap are kinda naive believing that once these folks get power their problems will fixed the shitty truth won and can the way they would want edit but respect them for shaking things ,1
 why you hate other parties apart from aap how does khujli dick taste are you corrupt mind have you benefited through corruption you blindly support some other party you support some party because your caste religion brahmins bjp and muslims congress you don believe corruption can eradicated indian politics ,-1
your questions are absolutely ridiculous and shows how out touch with reality you are the world not all black and white just because someone votes for support particular party doesn mean they hate the others definitely don hate aap don like their solutions problems and don care for their style politics don see how anyone can logically expect adding more bureaucracy lokpal solve the problem corruption that was created too much bureaucracy begin with similarly their election promises free water and cheap electricity everyone what one the richest cities the country backward step when should moving away from govt subsidies for everyone all means support the poorest the poor with all the subsidies the world but there reason why the govt should lose money powering the air conditioned bungalows the super rich delhi the poor barely have any electric appliances this country the only way they are going able pay for such subsidies increasing tax revenues which will primarily impact businesses negatively and the domino effect will affect job creation etc aap anti capitalist tilt pretty evident anyone who isn totally blinded their anti corruption talk just because they claim have good moral stand corruption doesn mean should blindly trust them with all aspects governance clearly lot people delhi not agree with and that perfectly fine they are entitled their opinions and choices just like entitled mine ,1
 many assumptions man just many least try possible neutral and unbiased you going for discussion ,1
 dont hate aap but your questions are example why disagree with their style politics your mind people who disagree with aap hate aap they are blind supporters some other party are corrupt caste ist there room for disagreement with aap and still honest upright citizen who wants good things for his country this extremism one the reasons why dislike the aap ,-1
 always hated self righteous morons ,-1
what hate about aaptards they mentally convinced themself that kejriwal the only option any other argument met with vehement resistance anti corruption rhetoric and personal attacks both myself and the party person defend can abide naked hypocrites self denial people who like hide from things they don want see and hear the last couple days heard kejriturd compare atal behari vajpayee scamohan singh also heard response modi honesty sound economic policies consisting nothing but anti corruption rhetoric the age old 2002 riots propaganda simply absolute silence and finally complete lack awareness interest the political realities scenarios aside from bjp congress bhai bhai lokpal swaraj kejriwal will save some deeply flawed and full holes way ,-1
 aap supporter but stop this with against bullshit ,0
why can disagree with aap policies without agreeing the reasons you have provided this ploy many who wants label somebody anti something for example you don temples you athiest you not hindu etc etc the simplest all reasons that self righteousness and pragmatism cannot mixed sometimes you will have take decisions that are unpopular against well established principles keeping mind future benefit and common good you cannot flexible such situations you are not doing any good administrator politician ,1
 bakchodi leaking again ,0
 corruption just matter legality financial irregularity and bribery the currency social transaction egregiously unequal society which power continues concentrated the hands smaller and smaller minority imagine for example city shopping malls whose streets hawking has been banned hawker pays the local beat cop and the man from the municipality small bribe break the law and sell her wares those who cannot afford the prices the malls that such terrible thing future will she have pay the lokpal representative too does the solution the problems faced ordinary people lie addressing the structural inequality creating yet another power structure that people will have defer you and your chutiyaapa,-1
 hate the aap because has absolutely real plans about improving the country situation corruption can only agenda for long there are problems this country more important and more destructive than corruption and the aap instead focusing them actually tries fuel those fires what will they when there some actual work done their delhi manifesto only shows promises they can hope meet irrelevant feel good policies that absolutely nothing for the country and the jan lokpal bill defeating corruption doesn automatically fix all the problems our country just like adding doesn result also disagree with the method they use defeat corruption they completely sideline development which instrumental and perhaps the only way about reducing corruption and instead focus doling out freebies limiting their exposure lower rung corruption and blaming other parties their daft policies are second reason not support them free electricity lower classes and reduction its price fixing vegetable prices have you learned nothing from the congress mistakes basic economics laal batti what the point that again your mlas will the only ones reach parliament half hour after assembly commences half salary for ministers this isn corruption bait the aap hasn single policy that makes iota sense the self righteousness displayed kejriwal and his goons worse than the emotional outbursts modi supporters the internet just watch any debate and cringe kumar vishwas yogender yadav throw unsubstantiated statements well accusations the bjp don care about the congress not going there they act though fighting against corruption the only reason for man descent from trees and thus are quick name the bjp and congress being the same without shred reason related either the stark differences their style governance the prosperity the states they govern and the level contentment within the people those states the fact that arvind kejriwal himself hasn proven his administrative skills and isn likely considering the fact that they hesitant about creating government delhi you know that thing they stood the elections dismissed them easily they dismiss the notion having agendas besides corruption ,1
 don hate aap but doubt their intentions ,-1

 just small party with noble goals their ideology seems bit muddled and bit too idealistic lots parties start out like this lot things their initial manifesto seemed very poorly thought out maybe that has changed but ultimately just like every other election there will mostly hung parliament and leadership will decided horse trading with shifty state level parties mamata jayalalitha mulayam singh cpm karunanidhi etc etc this one the things that holds progress back frankly whether bjp aap bjp power the country will the shitter really wonder how people think otherwise just look the last years after independance people really think regime change has huge effect anything for example home state west bengal had regime change the party tmc came power with huge promises barely see any difference honest think both the cpm and tmc are awful when power changes hands move from set thugs another not really strongly pro any party highly doubt any party will easily fix corruption india generally very jingoistic very young and strongly influenced peer groups facebook twitter media lot people here are right leaning and pro hinduism very small community and not really the kind place where you will find ton debate topics like this will generally very polarized generally don discuss politics with people since just reflection their adherence group think ,1

this very good stuff thank you for taking the time post here all the points you raised and the discussion points this thread have with government investment know this necessary but not the full picture there needs very strong emphasis removing excessive laws and regulation take your point raising revenues for the government you have listed five but there unthinkably large number activities people could only starting and running businesses didn involve interacting government officials second third tier towns the government can just provide basic services roads water internet millions small business owners could relocate out choked cities and spur local growth the opportunities are endless consider the city mysore under the classification the five would pretty much fall squarely under tourism but the government could give better power more reliable communications and better roads bangalore could very easily transformed into hub the revenues that come out the ecosystem will far exceed any the original five categories ,1
 see aap followers are conspicuous their abscence here the ideas seen here make you uncomfortable don want reminded kerjiwal non existent plans for economic revival and repairing the damage wrought the upa don like hearing good solutions that the aap can provide ,1
 this because import our oil needs and produce just and trade deficit makes matters worse depreciates the value rupee yeah only partly what about the indian oil prospecting companies that are allowed sell indian drilled oil indians international rates there are huge profit margins the wells reliance and vedanta this national resource that few people are being allowed profit from ,-1
exactly the reason don want aap ruin bjp chances supported aap only for delhi elections but now seems like they are driving confidence without proving how effective they are delhi bjp might have many corrupt politicians but overall has been more development pro than any other political party india can all write letter aap requesting them run delhi efficiently for years instead focussing this time ,1

for political party coming out nowhere not totally true but look their competition and completing their first anniversary only recently even they win seat will huge win for indians like who hope for better india who left better career prospects abroad stay india and something about the state affairs here the india which gandhi and patel and maulana and nehru and ambedkar and prasad and lalaji and gokhale and many others dreamt which kalam dreams which every citizen dreams the meantime you can cry some more ,1
 seems that they are taking congress too html vishwas believed keen fighting from rahul gandhi constituency amethi had earlier said have applied for lok sabha ticket from amethi and the committee will decide this html robert vadra issue there because involves famous person the fact everything like this happens everyday haryana certificate change land usage happens everyday one the well known analyst haryana chaudhary said that don have corruption haryana brazen loot course will make issue think aap extremely positive development for india they certainly have shifted the center gravity indian politics the cleaner side ,1
aap going eat away the congress and the regional parties vote much more than the bjp vote per the last known internal calculations aap expected get around seats while the bjp would still around 200 the biggest perceived advantage aap that they would contain the gandhis and the top congress leadership the seats being fought gandhis any loss there even significant decrease victory margin would huge egg the face situation ,1
aap has divided youth voters they are not dividing caste religion most the immature fanatics are young people who haven seen 1990 ,1
hahahaha aap supporter but boy love the fact they have made bjp and moditards run shit scared like headless chickens think the country owe big thanks arvind kejriwal just for making moditards realise they have not won the elections already ,1
lets steps want congress free india corruption free india ans corruption free does bjp has image being corruption free and would make india corruption free ans there party that gives that hope ans yes there are aap loksatta which are mostly going come together how can bjp fight ans definitely not lame arguments the team but beating aap their own game become more accountable the people rti transparent disclose funding sources remove criminals field better candidates and not the likes bokhariya radadiya yeddurappa until bjp ready compromise with its election strategy based our demands see reason whatsoever compromise with demands and vote for bjp this the only way fight aap not incessant wailing splitting hair and definitely not ridiculous fear mongering ,1
 there chance for the aap win any kind majority the 2014 lok sabha elections nor will any other political configuration have entered the world post election coalition parties you are making the assumption that congress gone that the third front will bad would not count either those technically would stupid for aap not try test waters let see how the results come out also please understand that not everything about bjp modi please try remember that when you examine what aap does ,-1
aare you referring that aap should not contest just because would cause political unstablitiy shud india declared state for the dynasty politics bjp and congress would against religion kill dont make take arms not stopping you make stupid comments reddit and raising confusing topic have vote and would happily give aap matter what politics equation means end doesnt justify means,-1
majority the voters dont even know what aap can tell you andhra pradesh tamil nadu aap the best case may cause swing votes the capitals this like the best case scenario they will not anything outside the metro regions government decided the smaller towns and villages urban folk dont give shit cant affect the outcome ,1

how political suicide they win and end with hung assembly the regional parties have been doing the exact same thing for the past years unlike them aap would end forming government being part third front ,1
arvind kejriwal thousand times better than congress opposition will make sure that bjp does not become another congress aap only helping achieve the target congress mukt bharat should welcome aap entry the scene although not supportive unfair amount media attention being given them ,1
false dichotomy either you are for for bjp you are out destroy the nation whoever has heard opposition that does their job properly and keeps the ruling party line ,-1
eli5 why does everyone else has nothing speak against namo except the riots mean has only one catch not juding him innocent guilty ,-1
man even though support aap would like bjp come power with absolute majority just because lot people strongly feel that they are the need the hour and bjp not make people lives better both economically and socially hope their supporters would criticize them enough make them change seek alternatives other than congress and bjp they perform well and good for everyone ,1
great post hope bjp supporters will explain their points and arguments against the aap succinctly systematically and without vitriol and aap supporters will forego their usual self righteousness and listen ,1
first all kudos you for summarizing some very thoughtful points against aap such articles are rare come this subreddit where most the political discussions end descending karma grabbing mud slinging matches and deserves more upvotes have your questions except for their infinite faith and ability simply presume good what the aap supporters base their support believe that the most the supporters have put their faith the past record activism one man arvind kejriwal which pretty much synonymous the case bjp main man narendra modi both their records are out the open for everyone see and fair kejriwal has been tireless social worker even before the whole anna thing blew guess both bjp and aap supporters need asking this question what happens when the sole leader doesn live the promises you vote for person ideology system how ensure that everyone sticks that ideology system modi fan myself but find very difficult answer that well the long run what can aap give that the congress didn and couldn only time will tell that one but most people are hoping for corruption free government lets see how far they take delhi the power collective good intentions the water and power policies not seem panning out how earth aap different from congress under the sun today same old minority appeasement same old subsidy tricks same old attacks narendra modi seems like aap the mirror image congress only under different guise you got there other than few fresh faces the same old system compromises over accountability hoping proven wrong they are freaking corrupt why the heck are aapians not putting them jail instead taking their help this what want understand give this one aap for they didn back down play the dirty game the situation demanded but there was good chance that bjp might have swept more seats there was election also their conditions stunt was just childish nonsense ,1
 short ideologically aap congress corruption bjp supporters needlessly worry about losing votes congress who should scared because their voters will gravitate towards aap what aap offering socialism which does appeal large section indians bjp more free market and has the baggage rss ,1
 find the question loaded bjp the standards which you need evaluate parties hint bjp not that awesome variety options better for functioning democracy left centrist party with baggage always welcome your points only bit worrying rest are just array silly exaggeration wrong assumption misrepresentations facts sure aap has its foibles but they are fresh kids with much less bad things than other parties come give them time prove their worth bit early write them off ,1
aap moving towards communist idea decentralization and putting things and people where they belong cpi and aap have both agreed this bjp and congress say something and something else point discussing ,0
 long they dont all right wing nuts and don have support from the likes kamdev and assaaram which the bjp has with aap ,1
 this the reason d84nwor r3a have started discussion elaborating apprehensions about aap hate aap because aap acting proxy for congress their jihad against narendra modi ,-1
 bjp has iconic and celebrated stalwarts like subramanian swamy clearly scholar learned person gentleman whose opinions should mull over analyze and imbibe with immediate effect ,1
long story short most indian voters are not really knowledgeable enough think too deeply about such things they support the aap mainly because the promise new messianic figure kinda like modi without any the baggage existing political parties ,1
bjp offering modi aap can offer anything worse than that tried ,-1
all those questioning aap taking support congress different people have different views his you asking why did take support congress others say should take congress support form government and show what can deliver the country now please you tell who should listen who would you have listened had you been his shoes the choice not simple but has listened his heart that what any sensible person his position would have done yes might succeed his commitments might fail but then the people are watching him closely should not atleast give him chance prove himself only been few days now and has stirred the political class with his stern decisions did bses ever dreamed that they will audited just within days becoming delhi can you already see the fears political class and corrupt the decisions and steps aap taking noone one amongst just like the friend you have who you roam around with everyday not vip just common man but his actions are not common all ,-1
 skulduggery aap made lofty impragmatic and somewhat unattainable promises but didn’ get into cumbersome details they kept deliberately vague how these promises would kept please read the manifestos the promises are nowhere tall the ones made modi for example the aap spuriously promised give 700 litres free water the poor and according media reports they delivered all good then right but they did not deliver they only gave metered houses not the poorest people the slums who actually are the need that water this actually gives incentive the people delhi get metered installed besides although subsidized should not free there will lack motivation save seems unrestricted even only certain level average consumption middle class family more less 700l the limit acts encouraging factor conserve since can relieve them the bill opposition nuclear energy honestly totally disagree with this move however still need wait for official statement the issue because the reason why aap protested against the kundankulam was due their perception lack safety measures their flawed economic model the biggest problem they are yet release clear well defined description their economic policies and models but this should give sense what their stand ,1
man you should write article for paper honestly ,1
 aap grows large enough will split into various factions like the janata party did each these factions will handle the different criticisms one will hindu aam aadmi party another will pro nuclear aam aadmi party yet another will free market aam aadmi party ,1
the bjp you claim more free market but don think opposition fdi retail they might have their reasons those reasons might justified but still not free market economics questioned modi tendency towards free market economics when his government banned gutkha not spitting and public littering but gutkha while leaving the ban alcohol intact not elegant enforcement penalties domestic violence public misbehavior but easy brute force ban alcohol the ban gutkha caused drop areca nut prices don know about gujarat specifically but speaking couple farmers karnataka where the congress govt banned gutkha understood there was drop about prices much for free market economics this concern regarding anti laissez faire was accentuated bjp leaning towards preserving culture the recent official declaration their homophobia was just example one would want question the sanity the thought processes the upper rungs the bjp the congress too hasn shied away from culture preserving stances example the statements made the mangalore mayor condemning resort culture following the attack group reveling teenagers resort you asked what the aap will differently from the congress the aap was among the first political parties come out against section 377 the ipc that criminalizes anal and oral sex the bjp was among the first support forthrightly and directly criticize homosexuality western disease the congress came out against section 377 but seems more like move salvage some support when elections are around the corner despite having been power since the 2009 statement issued the delhi high court the congress motives here are questionable they also going after the power generation companies delhi irregularities are found expect lot high ranking politicians will incriminated this one more item that the aap will differently from the congress the aap seems delivering election promises however vague words have been followed actions unlike the congress you might consider not delivering water unmetered customers bad thing but this certainly encourages all customers install metered connections further consider such policies socialist something against given voluntarist leanings but this still better than crony capitalism where land offered throw away prices corporates such practices are the beginning the rise monopolies monopolies are irreversible without socialist revolutionary intervention between the aap and the bjp still undecided whom would vote for but the bjp doesn have that great case against the aap you make out while the aap might have displayed socialist tendencies the modi government hasn exactly displayed laissez faire the bjp whole not sure about given their spectacular failure karnataka you might worship subramanian swamy but think nut job you might say nationalism but say self righteousness and the bjp and their conservative culture touting support base has lot would much rather spend government money subsidies than statue not that proponent the former ,1

thaaaaank god and here was starting feel stifled reddit mean reddit all places ,-1
school complaint karne aadat nahi gayi teri ,-1
 had noticed too anti aap comments were getting large upvotes even though they were the same old arguments same old accusations sane comments reply these comments were getting large downvotes was hoping mods make another quality discussion has gone down announcement aiyyoiyer can testify since been commenting for aap side lot lately looking for the threads where saw this behavior question will those threads still show the large downvotes even after the users getting banned edit thanks ,1
why ,0
absolutely agree with you subsidies the worst solution will eventually lead increased taxes secondly their ideology based time tested failed model thirdly fear that they come power they may nationalize everything which seems very possible looking their present ideology ,-1

modi4pm had just for commenter gold mods wtf,-1
 people are interested knowing what were doing namoarmy were touch with couple bjp leaders get them ama this sub and that requires quite good deal effort considering that reddit not mainstream india but aap idiots who are already phd certificatebaazi have gone ahead and get banned because they think were gaming votes ,1
this not community some 200ish people who happen from india isnt this india where the topics discussion should about india and not about some frequent india visitors for any personal rebuttals name calling etc etc cant use instead its shame see the top post india bitch fight like this please correct wrong ,1
those that ran that sub were carrying out suspicious activity basically downvoting every comment that was against the bjp then downvoting any thread that had anything against the bjp was pretty sure that activity since when the downvotes would come they arrive huge numbers since was private sub many couldn see the activity that was happening there fuckers got jolt ,1

woah this sounds incredibly petty five out the top ten posts india right now carries positive stories about aap are you guys engaging vote brigading then modi4pm was troll for most part don know why was banned aap supporters seem more intolerant criticism than bjp supporters ,1
congratulations thank you for showing faith aap ideals and making sure the hive mind brainwashed into accepting our superiority for this effort you are awarded with 100 more free water and your power bill will further slashed ,1
ranjan jest had posted here while back asking people upvote modi4pm much they can get his score positive had jest again upvoted random comments his and few others had too wonder this related the same ,-1

the plot thickens ,0
 dont get one thing the subreddit concept can greatly used for containment like circlejerk namoarmy wants furiously masturbate and upvote namoarmy what the problem still didnt understand how the ban and your description related because they were influencing upvotes other subs ,1
isn there mod setting whereby new users account age day old week old even month and users with low comment karma lets say 1000 both metrics for india are prohibited and limited comments per hour time frame the sub this won affect users with account age older than year and comment karma low hundreds seen few these users and they are mostly nice and only engage posts which are off beat these guys are lurkers anyway doesn affect them most them won reading the recent useless drama here anyway this account age restriction can extended even year strat ever perfect but one major benefit this would the incentive just act like tool without fear getting banned would less because the cost just creating new account and engaging more right away will increase dramatically there incentive build repo and since time and effort will have been spent user build that account she will act better more cases than currently the case said strategy perfect but its about managing the chaos one should learn useful aspects from the best the chinese censorship apparatus they don ban most things outright that never works instead their most common approach make the user experience hell and shitty possible why would someone use facebook some other site service every minutes the connection timing out slow and what not the incentive use longer there those who will persist their numbers will fall rapidly and very low and the goal achieved mods should work this direction they can not ban everyone and shut shop they need make the situation for idiots not worth their while spent all this time spreading here ,1
saala online community itna natak ,0

even though not practicing christian christian born and indian citizen this frightens thought modi was different bjp leader pushing national unity and all sad ,-1
actually bangladeshi hindus should accommodated india for the very reason muslims are part this country much hindus when india was partitioned two nations were formed india and pakistan while india chose remain secular nation giving equal rights all least theory pakistan chose become islamic nation where hindus not have the same right muslims india has accommodate all muslims who wish part this country because founders our nations decided this people may grudge this decision but have accept and fulfill this promise pakistan the other hand doesn have accommodate them and doesn try much fact that hindus bangladesh are suffering because religious persecution also fact that muslims bangladesh are not suffering due religious persecution first rule anyone illegally coming from bangladesh india must deported but humanitarian causes take precedence and based that hindus should accommodated india know that many hindus their hate for modi are willing forsake hindus bangladesh little more understanding the situation required bangladesh was same india then hindus and muslims bangladesh would equal people are overlooking the fact that hindus and muslims are not equal bangladesh hindus and muslims are equal only india and hence this contradiction use pakistan and bangladesh interchangeably for obvious reason not talking politics here anyone disagrees please debate not get your political agenda here ,1
 bigotry thought you were gone with roch but how missed you how would india india without your daily dose muslim bashing bigotry ,0
 source will have accommodate hindus from bangladesh modi 1403963 html modi have responsibility toward hindus who are harassed and suffer other countries where will they india the only place for them ,-1
apart from tweets couldn find any source him having said this leaving that aside don think any bangladeshi should allowed till sort out our own problems also though things should equal there are few grey areas though there might illegal immigrants from both religions which should strictly discouraged hindu immigrants might also victims ethnic cleansing which case they would and should have higher priority ,1
how anyone going verify the border who muslim and who hindu refugees could from either religion welcoming one set should welcome the other for those wanking over modi saying india the only place for hindus hindus can nepal bhutan any other country asia too india not hindu country secular country ,1
well what surprising what else one expects from bigot like narendra modi ,1

tragedy india the rulers come from italy and the voters from bangladesh jai ,0

dat self righteous smug face lol first bangladeshi hindus are merely refugees but majority bangladeshi muslims are illegal immigrants and second what the most pita about bangladeshi muslims their sectarian and staunch anti national behaviour which causing huge disturbance most region ,1
 think that hindus both bangladesh and pakistan should given shelter india political asylum considering the international norms providing refugee politically abused and threatened people note that modi had said indian muslims are not indians that would not have been acceptable however giving refugee and integrating religious minorities from neighboring countries seems the right thing religious majorities those countries however need use legal modes immigration they wish rather than just cross over the border squat more resources ,1

 lokpal will clear corruption out india and even greater out indians highly unlikely corruption not crime but disease and remedy development education discipline change attitude laws and rules were enough change country years there would dowry khaps murders untouchability school donations india there would cocaine almost riots gujarat for straight years not because strict law against riots but because shift focus from religions roads and buildings administration and development lokpal aap what ram mandir bjp what poverty congress what reservation mayawati and mulayam,1
aap does not have the numbers get majority best you can hope for that the third fourth front get then they beg for aap support get who would then extract lokpal bill the cost for support ,1
 feel its herd mentality you see media and your friends criticizing and decide aap must bad uncool support anything they well how many have seen speech and read good news about him not many they don even read about and start calling him dramebaz surprised that people who oppose aap are against everything they well think has become ego issue many the people ,1
 the first place aap having real idea solution for any issue besides corruption big hit them the second place they don even have real solution corruption lokpal farce exaggerated dream all does add yet another layer investigative bureaucracy over the acbs cbi intelligence agencies cag vigilance commission and judiciary with them involved investigations will take even more time now but whether corruption will punished different matter and till date have yet hear answer for the very simple point what the lokpal members are themselves corrupt corruption has seeped even into the independent judiciary then why what use independent lokpal that leaves with reason vote for the aap this year beyond being disgusted and wanting spite the other parties which describes the majority their fans ,-1
 much the chaddiwalas out here india and facebook shiver their panties aap does not have the number gain majority and form the government modi going but aap could possibly form the opposition party and that could keep nda its toes ensure does not indulge too much corruption ,1
 you mean say vote for aap pass bill assuming very strong bill and let the country debt the vague notions arvind kejriwal water subsidy kejriwal new all these its like you are making engineering graduate the ceo multi million dollar company its likely going fall and guess what any chance any kejriwal proposed plans not work again going resign the bill can not throw corruption out this country all highly unlikely that even going happen another hand modi will develop the country infrastructure wise may look into matters like improvement rural areas problems electricity and water shortage etc arvind kejriwal just like small kid planning for summer the kid will have huge plans won realize the hurdles ,1

both unmarried but jaya goot more saries,1

 don know much modi but far jayalalitha concerned she takes very few inputs from any section most the decisions are taken her within inner circles which imo she could have broader consultation would very good she has stern mind take bold decisions ,1
how this pro amma says has higher revenue much much higher excise revenue but same fiscal deficit the extra money going amma pocket ,1
 not modi fan but think ridiculous compare development metrics two very diverse states very simplistic way look the problem ,-1
not fair comparison amma has hardly been power while modi his 3rd term amma previous track record not good she was voted the worst was worst governed state don remember back when she was power the 90s she seems have big aspirations read and has the potential deliver here hoping she turned over new leaf and doesn fuck things ,-1
this infographic only shows you how developed itself but doesn say anything about what amma herself did this honestly useless you are comparing modi and amma ,-1
seriously did you infographic maker even consider the fact that alcohol tax revenues are significant contributor the treasury top off sells almost all its alcohol from tasmac designated government liquor stores and has rule that only alcohol made can sold imfl this random edit really downvotes this why stopped posting india and even deleted account previously really irritating really says lot about the quality person who lurks here you can post decent rebuttal atleast have the sense refrain from discussion lazy press the button disrespectful the community one gives rat ass about reddiquette damn disappointing guys damn disappointing ,-1

why only amma significant part development took place under dmk too basically this info graph useless ,-1
there namo amma just nammaamma ,0
 don mind jaya problem she isn the one leading national coalition the chances her ever heading union government are close nil even the third front experiment succeeds against all odds way will mayawati mulayam mamata nitish etc set aside their own egos serve under amma say something about her not really showing the kind vision modi has economy infrastructure industrialization etc but the above will suffice she simply not going make ,1
wasn twain who said lies damned lies and statistics there popular joke which goes wife made millionaire used billionaire information such this gives you idea progress and development what you want see trend set trends truly understand where you are headed this gives you idea whether amma has made life better for her state namo has made life better for his dig deeper there are citations the sources information meaning don know the data trustworthy there explanation the calculation the data either all all very well created and absolutely useless information you really think about but really well sold ,1

didn start off with bigger base development than gujarat plus chennai ,-1
point the way very important less fertility rate and less infant mortality rate both are very important and good example social development ,1
 glad that are finally comparing politicians development rather than other tertiary fish market arguments looking officials data shows that gujrat not doing any better than the other top states none the less gujrat among the top which good think the vibe created that gujrat magnitude times better than other states extrapolation definitely doing better than most states but other states cannot ignored which are doing equally well this infographics gives some incite that ,1
ideally modi should marry amma and they both can pms guess the state that their progeny will rule will the most prosperous the world ,1
 can believe people aren even considering the reason these guys were willing wag their mouths the guy who made this video apparently promised compile their heroic deeds and report higher ups some hindu samaj get them handsomely rewarded now too hard imagine why one would eager reveal one criminal actions before complete strangers can believe the naivete this thread ,1
what our other choice ,-1
the amount muslim haters this sub too damn high ,1
this the reasoning have mind regarding post godhra riots modi did indeed order the genocide and protect the perpetrators did not order the genocide but actively allowed happen and protected the perpetrators did not want happen tried stop but couldn however after the incidents defended the perpetrators did not want happen tried stop the best his ability but couldn actively pursued many convictions possible after the incidents and are brainers there should doubt anyone mind that such person should not become the also not positive because the fact remains that could not stop people from dying with whatever control had but indeed true would give him the benefit the doubt because his track record wrt development since the riots but the unapologetic tone disrespect towards the media aggressive rss support convince that very unlikely that true hence modi not the right person lead the country especially with many other able leaders found even within the bjp edit grammar,1

 new search area pdf pdf looks like right top the diamantina trench ,1
the new search area very close diamantina deep considering how quickly the entire search force abandoned the previous location and that fact that the fbi was set have completed their analysis the captain hard drive they found diamantina deep his internet search history would both the kind credible evidence that causes complete shift search area but also something you absolutely could not release the public until confirmed with wreckage thoughts ,1
 does this debunk any ghost plane theories plane can make turns after new coords are input but never heard one automatically speeding ,1

here good graphic which have way verifying not sure already been posted not haven seen before shows overlay australia radar coverage and the last ping derived arc location the plane the arc goes straight through the satellite system which think already knew before someone highly motivated and with inordinate amounts free time could and stick there the various search areas and debris sightings that would super cool australia refuses confirm deny whether the plane was detected well according the trustworthy media but think either their system was down malfunctioned and they don want anyone know they did detect the airspace and are using that direct the search areas and are keeping secret for who knows why and need the doppler effect only cause cool either way can imagine that they did detect but are refusing use the info release other investigative agencies they spending boatloads money searching for this plane too and doesn make sense for them continue spending what they know incorrect also the plane was detected why would they keep that secret not like their satellite capabilities are secret don think this case the plane flying under the radar think this radar goes pretty low would have wasted enormous amount fuel and the pings probably would have cut off lot sooner think there good chance the plane passed through this region and wasn detected for whatever reason jpg,1
question possible the plane was programmed just before 000 fly that way until ran out gas and everybody board was dead ,1
 think easier hide plane for weeks than crash one and try find especially with countries and shitload satellites 24hr prowl with the whole world demanding answers ,1

mas ceo will give press conference 6pm myt ,0
the elephant the room that more than likely none the debris that the satellites picked were wreckage from mh370 remember either hearing the news reading article about how ocean currents that part the world often bring together all the stuff ocean has collected over the years bystander and already felt hopeless and frustrated can only imagine how the families and search rescue team feel ,-1
 the new analysis that the plane flew faster burned more fuel and travelled less distance these factors would lead less flight time but time air the most concrete fact the ping data confirms these points faster burned more fuel and travelled less distance work with the fact the plane must also the air for hours ,1
 confused they are saying the plane was traveling faster than they thought more fuel was being used traveled shorter distance but they have pings all the way assuming the plane had not yet crashed until least that moment which would have stopped the pinging there concrete amount time had the air how could travel less distance when was traveling faster for the same amount time are they saying that they overestimated whatever time after the plane was the air which would have had less than hour and that compensates for the decreased distance ,-1
considering that the current search area takes hours get hours search and hours return for the hours flying time think everyone should thank their lucky stars that the new search area turned out 684 miles the northeast the current search area toward australia turned out 684 miles the opposite way the planes would have had nearly zero time the target search area before they had turn back fuel ,1
 look into the lives malaysia airlines flight 370 pilots lmyqjaxmta0mdiwodeyndgywj far they have turned nothing unusual the pilots ,1

expert organisations analyse available data and determine the best area search the key pieces information being analysed relate early positional information from the aircraft and
later polling satellite aircraft system the new information based continuing analysis radar data between the south china sea and the
strait malacca before radar contact was lost indicated the plane was travelling faster than previously estimated resulting increased fuel usage
and reducing the possible distance travelled south into the indian ocean the international investigative team supporting the search continues their analysis which could still
result further refinement the potential flight path this has been combined with information about the likely performance the aircraft—such speed
and fuel consumption for example— arrive the best assessment the area which the aircraft likely have entered the water the information provided the international investigative team the most credible lead currently
have the search aircraft wreckage however this information needs continually adjusted for the length time elapsed since the
aircraft went missing and the likely drift any wreckage floating the ocean surface finally let stress that under international convention malaysia has investigative responsibility for
malaysia airlines flight mh370 this stage the atsb’ main task assist the search for the
aircraft this day the search for the aircraft… have drifted the area for days movement taking into account the actual weather and known currents atsb spokesman unsure what the actual speed was the assumption that the aircraft was travelling somewhat constant speed data from satellite polling and radar matches satellite imagery may may not objects and may not debris fields previous search areas have now been abandoned could debris wind scattered around the world depending who picks – under international convention remains the responsibility the country where the aircraft was registered any wreckage which picked will held for the malaysian investigative teams atsb operating behalf the malaysians any debris picked must handed over australian authorities new area will help get more aircraft scene for longer the other benefit the search area longer the roaring 40s – which means better weather conditions more often debris has been seen the old search areas does not want classify satellite and visual spots those areas debris that just not justifiable with what have seen adds that this kind thing not unusual this the normal business search and rescue operations the new area based refined data possible that further analysis may change that again what are you actually refining the relationship between 777 performance satellite pings and various projections versus that information trying find the right coincidence those and the end point when the aircraft runs out fuel all engines die together there are range scenarios you still believe the course changed several times the best assessment the aircraft headed south consistently into the indian ocean are you looking other leads from the malaysian investigation the two primary methods are the analyses the movement the aircraft that the best information can have satellite imagery being followed but has produced sightings sophisticated oceanographic modelling determine drifts recall please that this days after the event was expected happen over that days there’ significant amount random dispersion objects the search area gets significantly bigger over time data marker buoys are being distributed into new search area continue model drift and keep search area confined all data currently available has been made available the search ",1
here another hammer their quickness abandon the search area based this new data analysis plane speed means they have literally zero confidence any satellite images they have released over the last week does this means satellite imagery just not good enough useful this search all find this hard believe but with this current abandonment all can conclude that there ton floating garbage debris the indian ocean and satellites not able distinguish these pieces well enough this may truly impossible cause folks ,-1
the search area for flight has been updated after new credible lead was provided amsa more info here pdf,1
you know what seems fucked for and mind you this just train thought ordinary person these aircraft find debris drop navigation bouys subsequent aircraft and ships can swoop and pinch yet how many freaking bouys have they dropped and yet how many times have they gone for the search not saying fishy anything just wanted say how awfully difficult find any debris ,-1

 really happy see the comments here very well explained all the redditors sans few jerks here and there what huge huge difference between aaptards and modi supporters ,1
 right fine with that india got divided the basis religion and non hindus got nation their own why shouldn india cater the need the hindus plight from those countries because are secular fuck that why did the partition happen the basis religions then gandhi fucked over ,1
many countries make distinction between policies for asylum seekers and migrants common sense really ,1
dae think india initiated this kind policy will only increase the incidences persecution minorities pak and bangla imo should done only case case basis discretely and not publicly announced blanket policy ,1
blow modi ,0
 against this very clear how this works support the man doesnt mean that idolise him support his every move blindly means the field leaders that have available believe the best bet lead bring ratan tata the candidate for any party and they will have vote tldr support does not mean worship,1
india for indians only,0
hmm think the whole against illegal immigration and wants illegal immigrants sent back but wherever hindus are the minority and are being persecuted bjp wants them move india seeing india the only hindu majority nation this world tried arguing against this logic pointing out that there are already millions hungry uncared for indians who should looked after first rather than foreign national just because she hindu being persecuted have responsibility neighbor urge bangladesh protect minorities but beyond that against this notion should deport all illegal immigrants irrespective their religion grant them asylum needed case case basis ,-1
 take jab persons migrating legally should welcome all states should accommodate them infiltrators who enter the country illegally need tackled they tend disturb the regional functioning removed religious subtext less controversial interpretation ,1
very good ,1
this allowance refuge the base religion actually valid india was divided india east and west pakistan remember what basis religion bangladesh very much islamist state recognized hindus are seeking refuge due persecution they should allowed however muslims are crossing borders huge numbers than becomes whole new issue which would require diplomatic intervention ,1
old issue rehashed several time here modi wants india give asylum bangladeshi hindu refugees who came here escape persecution and growing islamic radicalism their home country increasingly common problem bangladesh but not bangladeshi illegal migrants general who just came here for economic opportunities because their numbers are simply massive and are causing major demographic changes several indian states ,-1
what wrong with that another lame ass attempt modi bow wow ,-1
 you know what are you comparing refugee status some people anti national scam awarding citizenship status some people think about and let know what you think ,0
 have answered this several times tldr whole heartedly agree persecuted hindus don have any other place earth except probably nepal somebody must help them ,1
 don need more poor people india are already nation with large scale unemployment and poverty why are allowing immigration people with little skills the reason why bjp wants pursue this create voting loyalists for the party congress has allowed unfettered immigration people belonging particular religion just increase its voter base ,-1
same they think this ,0
there are two categories illegal migrants first are those who want come india for economic reasons secondly those who are persecuted should provide asylum those who are persecuted and send back those who came here for economic reasons support modi stand this ,1
modi communalist the little fucker knows bangladeshi hindus are not facing any problems india but has play saviour role which had done gujrat for more than decade pakistani hindus are crossing border rajastan and they are welcomed and are given out ration cards bjp each individual welcomed with celebration ,1
what sickulars say about this live bangladesh for some years bangladesh secular isn ,1
why only bangladesh hindu and christains from pakistan are killed raped and murdered even secularist should accept them plus according these countries are hindustan why not support him ,-1
why does everyone assume those here further votebank agenda politics are only muslim all you are communal,0
here take india was partitioned belief that muslims living india will continue live unharmed similarly hindus living west east pakistans will continue live unharmed india will considered hindu nation where hindus migrating from west east pakistan will welcome take refuge muslims from india are free migrate pakistan now that hindus are not being treated well and they want migrate nation which was created for them they are welcome but muslims have their nation result partition they are not happy with situation there then they should try improve situation rather than move across border not question about hindu muslim question national resources national security and rights indian citizens hindus bangladesh are much minority that you will not notice they migrate india but muslims are migrating much population that has created severe identity crisis east india and pakistan with support china trying take full advantage that situation think beyond your hatered for modi and put india before anything else you will realize are critical situation with major threat from pakistan and china and have handle favor india without giving communal color ,1
this weird ,-1

 don care about his personal life but brought this upon himself was not right him deny her existence previous elections and now finally admit before this one the one who publicly claimed has one corrupt for reading indian express article about his wife she came off someone who still admires and respects modi and wished nothing but success for him taking that into consideration its begs the question how modi views women general ,-1
international media will eat this especially when modi becomes the and goes international visits without first lady child marriage exotic india the western media would have field day ,1
 now the former rss pracharak had left the column blank the last four state assembly elections 2001 2002 2007 and 2012 why ,0

 seriously wish somebody would tell what this ravish kumar trying say here that parties play caste politics that what fetches votes that moneyed interests support parties they support sin crime have money and support party your choice now right reserved only for the poor leaders cant wan raise stuff like poverty and retire expensive hotel why they need prove their aam nature sleeping the road mind you not critisicing supporting any one party here this all the reality india today and the people have gone large extent contribute tthis have you ever wondered why the south india has grown much faster clip because while caste important especially karnataka not hesitate vote outside caste norms are not satisfied with the governance the ruling party this why despite all the corruption here still leagues ahead laloo because knows cant sit his hands for years and ask for votes the name caste heck jaya brahmin and she wins landslide victories caste pox indian society even more north indian central indian states and that the absolute reality ,1
 have read extensively this election and sorry say that ravish kumar being partisan and giving one sided view here afraid will not surprised joins the aap soon like many other journalists ravish kumar talks caste politics and candidates being fielded the basis caste but acts like this exclusive bjp and congress which party does not field candidates caste and religion especially and bihar even aap has been doing the same thing many constituencies many their candidates many states are fielded according caste calculations vip candidates aap succumbs cong bjp ailments 1427157 html ravish kumar acts businessmen hotels have something with the elections are they campaigning for modi has seen them distributing pamphlets money even the businessman who publishing bal narendra comics has said only doing because wanted something that would sell not distributing free campaign material plus few tens thousands comics are completely insignificant voters national level the children who read them will not vote anyway and general ravish seems very disgusted their prescence why have private businessmen suddenly become evil ravish employer falls the same category and many the aap and bsp politicians seems rooting for are also big businessmen like sanyal balakrishnan etc ravish observes that aap and bsp politicians not use expensive hotels while others while simplicity admirable does not have any bearing politician skills administrator the left and tmc politicians west bengal and the communists kerala are known for their relative simplicity and modest lifestyles but they are otherwise very thuggish and have not delivered good governance for their states least for west bengal ravish should look relevant things like manifestos promises track records etc ,1

beautiful reads almost like poem ,1
 sad that every reporter who claims non partisan infact doing the bidding political party this was effort appeal the hindi speaking masses and love the construction but not the content how easily has bjp been accused indulging caste politics but there has been really been mention congress demanding all secular muslim votes the author failed mention that calling muslims secular all hindus are being labeled communal how easily has been forgotten that senior leader from aap demanded that muslims communal and the statement was later ratified the party the bjp has been accused putting star hotels but expenditure hoards aap workers being ferried air have been conveniently overlooked one cannot trust any form media person all everyone has make their own mind ,1
 would only like say war everything fair every party plays caste politics mean every ticket given the basis complex calculation what can you about this exactly what prompted selfpost how remove caste system that can come out this shit ,1
ravish far the best news reporter india his elections coverage has been exceptional and really both its freewheeling honest form and content unlike anything have ever seen life also seems the only one who can see through the absolute farce contemporary media their own sense exaggerated self importance really wish his prime time election coverage will win some sort award for outstanding journalism also great translation man thanks all the effort don disheartened the louts here who seem hogging the space with their inane posts need more posts like this edit ि् िाे ाा ी ्ा ीं करता ाे ाा ी करता ै । never knew ्ा could used verb also ूिा ु translates bhumihar dominated ,1
raveesh without doubt one the best reporter who does reporting from his heart however will not call him impartial seems have soft corner for aap and always shows that his writing and reports chooses ignore lot same politics played aap which congress and other parties are accused however still does not take away the fact that quality journo though not the impartial one think impartial journalism mere utopia ,1
 never hides his biharism that bihari makes extremely happy favorite new reporter never hides when doesn have complete knowledge particular subject fact says that first thing the program read his blog regular reader some the stuff there heart warming since have lived and seen those things ,1

 appreciate sentiments especially when call for moderating behavior that said this election was way about aap aap continues the same line will lost oblivion within yrs deservedly the way left the entire corruption plank all out against sm1 who prolly the best leader have was not just stupid but unforgivable also think presumptuous assume that there tommorow aap india has resurged from far worse times thinking that only select band people can lead salvation horrible idea the same way congress led believe tht they were the only ones who freed india ,-1
 don get all this aap small party some people here and look back their post history and check how many threads they have started criticizing aap aap small and inconsequential why the fuck are you people giving much attention you expect better subredit good luck with that the only thing that might change that the paid downvoters might disappear think they already have ,1
now that the results that they probably wont even open the account dawning aap supporters they are resorting the but got the moral victory route saw that twitter seeing here you might genuine but sorry the general experience dealing with the aap walas had made many man cynical some points aap not even strong regional party let alone national party let alone party replacing the congress mon party that many doubt will even open the account already your mind replacing congress maybe sometime the next decade but not now not even 2019 dont know what you mean aap revolutionized this election didnt see aap campaign anywhere except few pockets delhi amethi varanasi and few seats punjab compared the modi bjp blitzkrieg there comparison like not this election was about one and only man modi india against corruption was delhi movement not national movement attributing what was pan national phenomena cutting across rural urban divide high turnout delhi based movement sheer madness people are just getting more and more politically aware and the penetration internet rural areas and dedicated booth level management major parties the main reason for increased turnout aap ridiculed because its impatience nautanki hypocrisy inexperience above all the nauseating self righteousness when they are actually cut from the same cloth the rest same caste religion and criminal politics dont argue this enough links have been posted with aap politicians indulging all these except few brainwashed and few idealists one actually buys the crap that aap trying cleanse politics mean when someone says wants clean politics and then takes tacit support from goons like mukthar ansari bsp etc you know they are just shitting had not accepted all poltiicians are corrupt that all institutions are damaged beyond repair and need kranti things need changed from inside constant small manner and not the jaldi badlegas which will only result egypt like chaos perhaps aap actually wants this not sure for under years need party that fuels hope focus capital building infrastructure development improving job market improving economy general providing decisive and efficient governance bjp the party for that and hence the overwhelming support for amongst this demographic years later once modi retires need not worry since bjp has awesome bench strenght and talks are already start grooming manohar parrikkar take over from modi need genuine secular left wing party play perfect complement right wing bjp inc occupies that position now aap had chance develop into sensible left wing party but their actions betray deep inexperience arrogance nauseating self righteousness and incompetence they have all but squandered the goodwill they generated lot and nothing short miracle can save them unless they change their current ways hope they sink into political oblivion because the nation cant afford second congress winning matters but less joy able against weak opponents winning what matters not the opponents realpolitik suggests the weaker the opponents the better ,1

 going churlish and ahead and puncture your baloon one pointby one point certain that turnout this election result whole india against corruption movement even people who gave their votes bjp congress must have awakened aap some way turn out 2013 assembly elections highest ever assembly election history turn out rajasthan 2013 assembly elections highest ever state history 2013 turn out karnataka 2013 2013 despite what you might think voter turn out and interest politics amongst the young the middle class and the hitherto not interested educated masses not aap doing sure the iac movement anna hazare movement did raise lot eyeballs did the protests for nirbhaya but aap did jacksquat outside delhi heck fail get why you folks don understand core issue aap will non existent outside the ncr and maybe punjab they are non entity the south and west even the cities and the hinterland where some our population resides they are absolutely unknown but lets face aap much better opposition than inc for bjp absolutey not let paraphrase person you must dislike lot modi arnab interview said stuff said the heat the election campaign momentary run nation need the assistance every single party every single politics involves the art give and take negotiation and even the shitty congress stood firmly behind the nda when came pokhran 814 the flight kandahar the nda backed the congress some bills aap will not that they are immature and think any give and take the sign corruption and collusion aap will make for shitty opposition shittier ruling party and maybe fit only dharnas and make wild allegations none which will ever taken forward proven like the discoms ambani swiss bank accounts the hundred other baseless allegations they have made winning matters but less joy able against weak opponents most knew time has came for congress either change die forever aap has risen become worthy opponent don believe these poll results for aap just ridiculous that even after delhi mistake they under estimate aap wrong electoral politics only winning counts and what this ridicuolous logic you guys have convinced yourself about the congress not dying did not die did not die 2004 will still the second largest party will still rule odd major states this country will still command minimum vote share nationally can summon allies deadlock parliament needs has money has power has connections has pull the media you think congress dying you are absolutely wrong wait for aap shatter over the next years that bound happen but congress will remain wouldn even surprised pappu mrs vadra came power either 2019 2024 the least upa coming back power aap supporters are naive leaders when comes real politik atleast the way leaders potray themselves also delhi 2013 not the rest india heck delhi 2014 not delhi 2013 mark words again this aap will the second largest party with about seats the delhi assembly 2014 for jlp they will end losing everything state centre and goodwill the people thinking about this scenario with eye future see bad times why party getting much ridiculed for cleaning politics what load rubbish what cleaning parties aap did the following subsidy raj hooliganism only smaller reach they are smaller party endless political drama the cost governance what the difference between mamta not doing anything bengal and claiming moist conspiracy and ak49 doing nothing and claiming the bjp ambani hand behind their absolute non performance associating with absolute communal muslims like taufeeq raza guy who ordered taslima beheaded jamiat islami hind the name being secular aap saar the exact replica the congress bsp tmc they have huge corruption scams their name yet did tmc have the taint scams till took power give time the average aap neta will also very similar the average political goon why you people have forgotten inc they are responsible that are where were yrs back like that india will not like where maya and mulayam romance people alternately lmao truly lmao aap forgot inc real life where ak49 has not mentioned the name rajmata her brood even once publicly except when last minute added her name his list corrupt even these forums which amount nothing irl have seen this behaviour aap aap leaders and followers who skewed the debate away from inc and failures into making some mission stop one man who the least corrupt big margin amongst leaders india today anything aap had virulently campaigned amongst support base small group educated urban indians against the inc the approx vote share would have also come the bjp and might have resulted lesser seats the inc and maybe maybe truly weakend that party but nope you guys had skew the debate away from your handlers ak49 janpath agree wholeheartedly with you the rest your post about keeping clean clarify this post not addressed you individually but the larger superset aap followers here mean offense you and post has hurt you any way please accept apologies lastly still think the exit polls are absolutely horrendously over bloated towards the nda and the nda crowning not certain and aap feel will get seats and not back empty handed fingers crossed ninja edit typos spelling mistakes etc long post didn truly clean all that said surprised you left out bjp and modi efforts rallying the masses that man accomplished some herculean stuff according the latest india today report has directly participated some 500 speeches been part holograms chai charcha etc some 000 has travelled some 000 and apparently met reached out the total bloody electorate you might dislike him you might hate him but you might want respect him his professionalism single minded focus and absolute bloodymindedness the face opposition from almost all other parties across india and about the sucession plans premature though they may the bjp for all the faults non bjp supporters find with truly democratic meritocratic party and the distant future get parikkar chouhan would say they are arguably the best this country lead aside from amma but meh her corruption and arrogance will come her way ,1
agree with you some parts hope aap becomes larger and mature party the coming years but they need acknowledge learn from their mistakes start respect and admire the good work done others aap should also project same image they give impression that only they are the saviours ,1
 local government deals operational level example municipal corporation union government deals strategic policy level aap perfect for local level but their policies are too socialistic and backward for developing country should they develop superior vision will support them primary concern economy and education believe the more educated our country the better leaders will have will support aap city level every single day but they need mature and gain depth for the national level ,1

 had massive respect and high hopes for kejriwal and aam admi party until quit government delhi and jumped into elections for the reasons still can comprehend top that with his crusade against the most corrupt communal modi communalism worst than corruption development only corruption gujarat and the greatest them all muslims plz communal ,1
itt fucking immature retard making his point and someways proving truly belongs aap ,-1
when would aaptards realize that aaps plan simply align with the congress officially few years ,-1

not political enthusiast but have share this aap gave ticket one the farmer loyalist area and the guy made live phone call aap leaders and their party offices asking for some monetary assistance their reply was don have any money while their leaders were enjoying huge foreign fundings after few days they stopped picking his calls ,1
you sound genuine but let give you simple answer aap not national party just fighting elections from all the seats from india doesn make you national party you actually need win them and for that you need have structure place may next decade think even bsp once fought elections from lot seats india still considered regional party well kind but you get the point ,1

 ananthamurthy was mistake phat gayi dont understand how someone can say will leave country someone gets elected that basically says you not believe the due process your country and dont care about how the rest your countrymen feel since are democracy there mistake here basically had said fuck you the rest the 850 million voters smarter than all you collectively now sir gtfo,-1
 slightly unnerving that dissenters are being spoken treated like this very much democratic and necessary have dissenters such ananthamurthy although some the things says are crazy everyone entitled their opinion long they don force others why should anyone else care ,-1

 modi victory triumph advertisements and media management said what shameless fellow modi spoke 477 rallies rahul spoke less than that and modi rallies were lot bigger average not acknowledge that hard work part nature elitists like him who sit their ass and feed themselves old glories ,-1
bjp let alone nda has clear majority with wide margin fully expect them fast track all the good work and make some drastic changes this five years that will establish their ground for next years anything short this would disappointing would not have such expectations they had barely formed coalition majority ,1
 few other anti muslim innuendos few clearly you haven been following india for the past few months don think there anything worry about though mean what the worst that can happen modi the bjp can anything that goes against the constitution the court judgements even comes ram mandir issue ,-1
hope they sideline issues like ban beef export cow slaughter ram mandir asylum for non indian hindus etc uniform civil code good thing though also let see what they will about the much talked about black money swiss banks direct income tax reforms measures prevent corruption police reforms judicial reforms foreign policy changes curbing illegal immigration failing act not option coz the end the term they won have any excuse they have majority their own don have worry about the coalition dharma bullshit also free from the influence jaya maya mamata ,1
this precisely why was afraid the bjp coming into power don care about 2002 but would very pissed the state becomes embroiled religion some has already happened with this thrust promoting indian values whatever the hell they might please give development and economic freedom don thrust religion culture down our throats you let the people decide who put power not let the people decide what they want read what they want watch and what values they want adopt ,1
need absolute focus development supporting farmers and industries cultural imperialism hindu values ban valentine day nonsense regulations women working late these are all issues which will the critical eye with which should watching our government ,1

 totally agree the bjp party have heard have promoted religious advancement whether purposely accident instead fixing india social reforms and poverty stricken lands believe the bjp nationalist view the right view towards aiding the country benefit the people and social development not the economy lets just hope that modi will focus less his religious aspects india and more the country health have also considered the samajwdi party for their socialist views equal india with healthcare welfare and working rights for all will surely benefit the country but looks like they are not having too much recognition but please want hear more from the people who are actually being affected this election just interested student from the states,1
lets not ak49 this new govt give years and comment ,1
dae find amusing that the same comment the top comment and the bottom comment this thread wtf going here facepalm ,1
let him make government lets see who his cabinet people were worried about all those elements before and after elections gujarat and before loksabha election bjp not even governing the the states india wants win 2019 wants get some seats and increased his voteshares kerala and will worried doesn any development work promised and wins 2019 then will back hindutva most voted for modi bjp not modi supporters 180 million indian voted for him pretty sure there are more than hard core criminals voted for modi rahul doesn mean modi rahul criminal too ,1
 religious things include ucc 370 and illegal immigration then they should certainly they can prioritize development over but they should deliver their manifesto what with people claiming they shouldn the things they stood for and got votes isn this why hate politicians that they discard their agendas and manifestos after voting certainly think they should everything that they promised long tune with the constitution they should also not things that are the polar opposite what they said they said sabka saath and sabka vikas and they should live its spirit being pluralistic also ,-1

 can really understand why keep getting these submissions from what appear first time voters rss the ideological mentor the bjp both abv and namo were former pracharaks rss has influenced and shaped the way they and most their would ministers think why should the bjp disown its ideology just please section the college going first job junta the voted for modi but not cool with the rss bjp better stay away from them else vote will aap next time crowd while one wants modi give any importance the lunatics the sangh parivar expecting him the bjp stay away from their ideological mentor stupid voting for the left and making submissions about karat staying away from socialism the bjp has put emphasis development and that where their focus should but issues like the ram mandir should way forgotten just because handful first time voters want edit don forget construction ram temple also part pre poll promise and lot people would want see that happen not because don have enough temples india but because will the logical conclusion the movement that for the first time asserted hindu nationalism the temple about restoring the lost pride not very different from construction somnath temple post independence the razing the mosque was sad event but when plea hundred years falls deaf ears frenzy takes over ,1

 maybe just jaded but sounded like any political speech you expect from someone who describes himself nationalist lots patriotism and talk about future hope for the country attended speech given him before and very good orator this fine speech but hardly something that makes you shed tears perhaps the effect profound because his predecessor was someone incredibly ineffectual and passive ,1

talk about friggin priorities and when does city renaming fall into the purview central government amc gujarat government hasn yet bothered why should central government care proud gujarati and very comfortable with the name ahmedabad ,1
whenever people change name place they destroy history don agree with bombay called mumbai madras called chennai our future generations won even know that were was such place called madras calcutta and especially oppose renaming because these cities were made foreigners themselves although don really mind allahabad called prayag because muslims didn made allahabad they simply renamed however mind hindus change name bhopal bhojpal some people want because bhopal city was founded afghan mercenary whoever founds the city have the right name and people rename then they are culprits destroying historical relic ,1
everything easy for the fucking govt they extort money for such purposes that new level disgusting had hit list this fellow would suppose ,-1
this thread intellectual orgy let settle the score going back our roots khallas,1
why according all places should retain their names they were the time independence ,0
why would you want change history and why that are far more comfortable with british era monuments and buildings than anything from the mughal period this just more anti islamic more importantly denial history view the mughals lived one they didn just turn this country into big factory like the english they are much part our history the marathas the rajputs anyone else they influenced our culture dramatically you really want undo their effects you have undo every single mughal influence our culture good luck doing that and btw you going this like see equal changes any english names and buildings well starting with lutyens delhi,1
 fully support this initiative can this nationwide scale one shot change the names say 000 cities and 000 roads one shot that would fun come swamy where your ambition alternatively rename them names from least 000 years back refer old texts myths ,1
this what happens you grow your own weed kids ,1
what mughals british ashoka did beside the point they are part our history and can whitewash that what can change what leave for our future generations create new cities called prayag karnawati create new canals called saraswati create new industrial cluster called vishwakarma its about time forgo our reverse colonial psychology and move forward ,1
 much like swami master troll sorry the master troll there are thousand and one super urgent problems facing our new prime minister and wish him the best tackling those renaming cities not one them once completely eradicate poverty our women are safe the streets any time day both the cities and villages electricity and clean water etc etc once all that done yea let discuss this renaming any politician brings the renaming issue its because they want keep the people distracted from some nasty shit being pulled off let smart and let not allow ourselves get raped again ,1
yes because that the most critical issue facing this nation fucking idiot ,-1
 just think unnecessary cost the exchequer and the government will likely fight tooth and nail and likely get some ammo for the assembly elections ,-1
please stop this renaming don give shit what place called even the word india not indian are gonna change that too ,-1
lol ministry swamy how long before turns modi and starts singing praises jayalalitha ,1
almost never agree with this idiot but its high time allahabad should renamed back prayag ,-1
 also said easy for govt but doesn have done also why are many people opposed even suggestion its line with indian heritage ,1
this guy makes sense sometimes but also says the most retarded things whole bunch times people like names which they are familiar though changing names under british india wasn bad enough after years actually suggesting the changing names which are many hundreds years old this kind tokenism much worse than the kind congress stood for ,1
these touchy religious nutbags again how about focus some real issues for change instead majority appeasement ,1

 should use the language most proficient its hindi gujarati ,1
 will proud moment for all indians when delivers his address hindi this september ,1
 first thought this some rajnath singh anti english joingoistic drama but after reading comments feel satisfied and believe should ahead with hindi only ,1
good initiative however heard him taking the oath and found that his hindi has strong gujarati influence perhaps could take some lessons improving his diction for all people criticising modi would like know their stance hollande spoke french merkel spoke german while addressing international press conference ,1
ugh typical bjp imposition hindi their predecessors bjs were hindi zealots this big fuck you regions india that not speak hindi fuck north indian cultural imperialism ,-1

why this such hot topic debate modi more comfortable hindi gujarati then has every right use should merkel always uses german and putin always uses russian etc why should modi use english ,1
thats good has very strong command the hindi language hearing some our politicians speak english makes cringe because their poor grasp causes the impact their message lost let the translators their job ,1
 ammal was director kalaignar fulfill legal requirements the company and she does not know any language except tamil her counsel told the court addition shanmugasundaram said she can recognise anybody except close relatives and that she years old and needs medical attention health grounds won oppose the bail application moved dayalu ammal said the public prosecutor lalit however opposed the bail pleas all the other nine people accused the money laundering case including raja and kanimozhi dmk rajya sabha and minority shareholder kalaignar ,1
not opposing bail not the same dropping investigations everyone but the most dangerous criminals are entitled bail dayalu ammal not active politician business woman she just someone propped director meet govt requirements this very common thing all companies since until last year you needed directors shareholders for private limited company you wanted start business and doing all the hard work for why would you want give away shares stranger you just get your wife mother daughter etc some other family member you trust will not act against you the other shareholder directory makes more sense for woman because they get better tax breaks and also the misogynistic reason that they are under someone control wah modi modi runs the executive branch the government the judiciary courts are not and will never under his control the courts grant bail not even the govt prosecutor agrees the bail the judge can refuse and the judge can deny bail even the govt prosecutor demands otherwise ,-1
 think this because many the accusations made earlier had evidence back results wild imagination fueled prospect gaining political capital maligning the opponent secondly there another issue that often these allegedly corrupt guys hid their tracks well ,1
maybe because aap lok sabha candidate from hisar yudhvir singh khayalia gave him clean chit ,1
modi fixing the bureaucracy maybe does not need the distraction yet ,0

parties don act the law does give them their due process the parties government should speed yes but there some more important shit atm ,1
because they that vadra the congress will the same them when they come into power and you have retarded believe the congress won come back power eventually there implicit agreement between political parties that because every politician has some skeletons his closet the degree varies but every politician corrupt the very nature the game attracts certain kind player they bite vadra right now the congress will come back bite them ,-1

there personal vendetta and the law taking its course the more they talk about know media will say vendetta over development and the true faces and colours are showing and all that nonsense what not personal vendetta was quite rightly election issue have idea why you confuse these two people india had reminded about damaad shri especially the time elections and that what bjp did looks like you want namo not allow the law take its own course and make this priority then modi above the law headline waiting which will followed the evil dictator reference seen enough will the right thing your efforts equate nda with upa downright silly ,1
 would say that congress has used the cbi create incriminating files all opposition members probably same with bjp the same way how and bsp hate each other yet have done nothing against each other when they come power ,-1
suppose bjp starts acting against them what you think will happen let give you the idea everyday there will news how bjp leaders are more corrupt and with full proof evidence which might put bjp lot more trouble ,1

that terrible article say that language will help cultural reawakening slippery slope argument culture not something that static our culture has been evolving over the last century just has been over the last millennium mixes and matches with everything comes across and this mixing and matching very much integral part any evolution say not doing right and that should start over again just plain stupid can speak english and just indian the whole idea decolonisation just pandering nationalistic sentiments and picking examples memes and expressions language saying they not culturally relevant just rubbish the author had read the story ganesha ganesh chaturthi would have come across the expression elephant headed like culturally lost use that phrase including the depiction attaching the head onto body read any decent english literature wouldn feel squirmy inside the idea corpse nailed cross can imagine where drew these examples and can cross fingers anymore give fucking break misses the point completely culture formed ideas and language simply meant for communicating these ideas when you get down the fundamentals all just the ideas that matter you can have the same culture yet speak different languages ,-1

 agree with this article but all languages come from sanskrit and sanskrit was brought iranians can speak the languages related the oppressors also hindi influenced from persian and many other oppressor languages think should only communicate sign language that the only way completely decolonize our mind although not communicating all would better which can also solve the biggest problem that hindus face the oppression different views but can afforded but not the international sign language because developed west which oppresses need develop our own sign language ,1

what caught eye was his pointing out the application the term sacred history semitic faiths and myth non semitic faiths including course hinduism amused because ‘sacred history’ deliciously creative euphemism for ‘christian mythology’ concrete and real sounding the word ‘mythology’ have noticed over time reserved anglophones for any non semitic stories greek norse hindu buddhist roman etc whereas when comes time describing their own mythology anglophones use ‘scripture’ and never ‘mythology’ but think ‘sacred history’ even better implying there ‘real’ history and then ‘sacred’ history which true there history and then there myth and ends thus with exceptions like amitabh ghosh’ ‘the shadow lines’ the entire corpus indo anglian literature leaves little cold like making love through interpreter ,1
the biggest problem with hindi any regional language compared english that thry dont evolve live the computer age how many know the hindi any regional language words for computer the internet now compare this german arabic the moment something comes out english are ported these languages immediately never see that any indian languages ,1

 favor look the banner this subreddit now look your words your words match with the spirit this subreddit can you not understand that muslims are large group people and they not all act and think the same but when you lump them together they then you are the one causing problems you think you not have any prejudice against muslims all that these are truly words you believe you will able live with muslims alongside you brothers don think you are going judge every muslim you see based these things you written above which many them have nothing with then how can you expect peace and civility among and with them why surprising that muslims are sometimes violent agitators and sometimes victims violence just hindus are islam and hinduism deal with violence and they deal with peace because they are religions for people and people are violent and people are peaceful your post isn enlightening anyone all you are doing spreading hate towards people you not know there are peaceful muslims and violent ones and there are peaceful bjp members and violent ones parties and religions and groups are all made people and you not account for that diversity then you will never able deal with other kinds people there are mullahs who speak against violence the bohra syedna one can think and there are mullahs who provoke just like there are politicians who speak against violence and those who promote cannot have outrage all the time there isn enough time each day outrage over every bad person the world but for every bad action there are some who are outraged regardless religion any other silly grouping factor again look your words look the banner this subreddit does this post belong here ,-1
wow such deluded hate the anti muslim brigade could maybe spread little love around than cherry picking and spreading lies and hate maybe you should talk about how islam encourages charity and compassion wait they don pay for that they and remember when you generalize 8bn sect the basis small group amongst them you are better than the called muslims who spread violence and hatred you just following their footsteps and claim have higher moral ground ,-1
 tired this bullshit let assume that you are right and take this statement not believe that muslims are minority india they are not minority they are the second largest majority this minority image political stunt gain votes plain and simple then again indian muslims are not one homogeneous block they have sects taken whole they are not minority islam violent fascist cult whose goal convert many people possible tolerance not only absent seen weakness that can taken advantage granted there are problems with the teachings the religion evidenced many but which religion without fanatics remember that reformation like event has happened islam instead the broader muslim world seems getting caught often bloody debate about who the true muslims are you need similar case point look ulster ireland torn between catholic and protestant fanatics who are often violent isn the goal christianity too convert the maximum number people all religions can called violent fascist cults parts the christian west the religion has more elements common sense but you cannot deny that blind fanaticism still exists the problem the muslim world not helped the least the fact that modern education and science are often frowned upon add this the problem economic deprivation and you have situation where religion becomes the opium the masses whatever this religion proclaimed high priests and imams seems believe will exactly what the people will lap that said there are several muslim scholars even supposedly evil saudi arabia who have called the taliban and isis exactly what they are terrorists the attitude muslims fringe extremist elements seems one passive ignorance and hence support cannot comment this not muslim myself and hence cannot speak for the community there great deal hypocrisy among muslims when comes calling out the sins their own too find this selective outrage targeted israel strange given the fact that muslims are slaughtering other muslims iraq iran and pakistan islam the single biggest danger that india faces today and must strictly dealt with matter what takes corruption bigotry and ignorance coupled with economic deprivation are the biggest threats india today islam just religion ,-1

 completely agree this what been trying say here most redditors here see anti muslim comments and immediately start screaming hate without thinking that the feelings may justified due india historical and ongoing relationship with muslims yes india tolerant state and has always been one but muslims general don see tolerance something aspire emulate they see weakness exploited the path turning yet another country into islamic one see evidence this even outside india just look the actions muslims take western countries which they achieve even somewhat significant proportion the population ,1
disclaimer muslim hope you considered that you cannot blame the whole community for the action few know not few but these blood thirsty people cannot considered muslims those who kill innocents are strictly not muslims they may call themselves but are just blindly using religion excuse islam doesn approve encourage wars against non believers most these just uneducated people who have nothing please hope you change your wordings and place groupings carefully for you continue scout topper would soon degraded damn terrorist ,1

just for the context this thread context most the offensive comments stand deleted just posting context the top comment was something the lines mass killing and ethnic cleansing mean there was even one user who corrected saying wasn ethnic but religious cleansing wtf does matter then plethora muslims must pakistan and such mean all for trolling troll all you want but the moment you step from harmless trolling into lel kill teh maslims then not trolling class douchebaggery reddit free speech site yes but free speech doesn mean you espouse hate and killing regularly bicker with rahulthewall and both and know harmless has never fucking lost his temper but then one you gents start calling him aapiya and what not and the discourse moves from lels don want listen you because you once wrote something favor aap really guys that fucking mature please ahead and troll all you want but don bring mass murder into discussion and please don call left right center because that fucking ruins any discussion with without lels ,1
whats wrong with letting downvotes decide what goes and what does not you first say the propaganda not combined sentiment india but then say that these hateful comments got upvoted the top which that what this group made then that what the group made all the rules shutting people will not help and what someone calls for killing all terminally ill vegetable people that hateful genocide talk the non painful killing certain parts society for some argument for good society then what can not discuss these ideas ideas like these ones why put religion some holy pedestal that cannot touched dirty hands why mods want get into the business controlling content here because you can get into legal trouble for whats posted here think the only time you should intervene when people make personal attacks one another personally but one here can assume the responsibility defending group matter how that group defined cents edit typos,-1
though these new rules are bit against the concept free speech but these were required considering the kind discourse that has been happening over the past few days the mods ,1
what the self post funda pliss eli5,0
can also regulate use flair there some bloke here that has real freedom islam free india some bigoted nonsense like that personally would love see active muslim involvement this subreddit addition the other demographics would nice peoples flair wasn uninviting india belongs the muslims too ,1
yaaaayyyyy the mods have heard have been asking for propaganda flair for some time now for posts making claims about their favorite political party without any source citations knew that the mods would like this idea ,1
seeing that all you mods are basically either aap sympathizers just plain anti bjp hindu can have couple right wingers the mod panel will defeat the whole purpose this sub ,1
 sorry putting here but the unverified twitter rule isn working seen several links unverified twitter accounts getting india front page agree that difficult moderate but having rule and not following following sporadically worse than not having the rule the first place please have look into the matter ,-1
this great initiative and can think any better solution the problem hand however fear that may too much work for you the effort required manually monitoring all comments would much greater than your present workload far the sub has been moderated very well the motivation your team for essentially thankless job certainly not lacking but pretty soon will having thousand concurrent active users well guess you would have already discussed the consequences the move just hope that the everyone was board with the added responsibility you later feel that this not possible the sub can potentially brainstorm over other possible solutions though presently have none offer will certainly awesome you pull off best luck ,1
this indeed turning into stasi circle anyone the circle considered civil and normal anyone outside the circle needed beaten broken down and reset and brought into the circle when did profiling someone from comment history became rule this civil ,-1

 commend your initiative and willingness micro moderate nothing else just one recommendation though already have the funda really need separate flair for moderated can just say that all religious discussions will marked default this will make simpler for all parties concerned lastly worry that this step becoming alarmingly like the ones taken the censor board the early 2000s there flavour know what best for you and you have choice but abide what say feel that should trust the voting system unmoderated environment get true feel what content relevant assuming most folks here are not children and extension there should need direct their actions anyway maybe you guys had different picture mind wish you and the sub all the best going forward ,1
ideally affordable health care should human right india has been spending much less than other brics nations healthcare and education and this definitely needs change fdi assisted insurance programs combined with government subsidized healthcare might way this however given how things progress india not sure this will ever become reality the opposition plans putting the insurance bill into cold storage through the rajya sabha majority not sure how the kind subsidies required implement this kind program will affordable for populous and mostly very poor country like india ,1
who will pay for ,0
don already have free healthcare what are those government hospitals doing ,1
while there may multiple concerns about the economics the situation this entirely step the right direction spent internship studying the indian healthcare sector and tbh woefully under equipped mean you get only small glimpse when you see understaffed govt hospitals the reality much much worse suffice say that serious epidemic broke out today the hospitals would hard put service even the population that comes them ,-1
the fuck healthcare still cheap fuck india fee government hospitals insurance will only fill the pockets insurance companies and doctors will keep raising fees the name insurance this great are not first world can least bring first world problems into our country ,1

short term looks like great idea long term doesnt this take towards where america today severely bloated healthcare costs because everyone has insurance and the pharma companies hospitals collect directly from the insurance companies shouldnt the answer moving towards high quality but affordable health care for all rather than insurance for all ,1
 one had good but other hand will have same situation health industry right now damn super expensive for everyone you don have health insurance you are screwed have mix response this but hope narendra modi makes sure that health industry does not turn out like health industry ,1
 this gets through will one his greatest achievements important the health insurance stays restricted only government hospitals don want become like the west where medical bills are grossly inflated solely because they are covered insurance already that way number bigger private hospitals,1

 wary such rules because the ones enforcing them can never fully objective and everyone even mods have biases for instance the nature the ban temp ban otherwise number warnings depends the user’ history and the kind comment question hate speech users with singular agenda will banned instantly with warnings most users here have agenda some very strong but don see any action taken most cases ,1
for long time this sub reminded the rediff comment section where every remote post about india pakistan prompted unwarranted hate towards particular community more less the same here where the ride top comment based the jasbaat rather than logic rational reasoning ,1
hate towards chetan bhagat kapil sharma infosys and bollywood movies there some shit all these but for lower and middle class folks coming from small towns includes who studied govt schools and had little access resources that average indian seem have gotten there still lot them one improves intellectually with time but imo hard catch everything that influenced one upbringing next time you see genuine person posting some nonsense facebook think about his her background she might victim all that exist printable form accurate childhood ,-1
 polygamy should banned first let say that atheist and reasons for disagreement have nothing with religion but more with adult right define what marriage family means him her personally have intention marrying again but this argument extension opinion homosexual marriages every consensual adult should have the right marry whoever and however many times government has business this the problem with the current muslim personal law that only allows men and not women woman wants marry men why not men and women want cohabit together like family who stop that the only role government that see ensuring that all such marriage contracts are equal and not discriminate against anyone and that rights children such marriages are properly protected ,1

what the problem the place getting cleaned the place had been left dirty people could have cause for complaint large crowds people are like this the world over have been several music festivals sports events and concerts all over the globe sometimes patron and sometimes cleaner would take offence the the child labour and low wage rates would take offence the lack gloves viz vest filter mask and proper disposal methods the actual act cleaning should give noone offence ,-1
interesting hear this coming from modi right wing hindu nationalist ,1

when modi asked for people participation keep the nation clean meant exactly this perhaps should have spelt out these dumbass kids whose parents never taught them clean their litter after them few years ago had opportunity talk reporter from the hindu who told story sometimes the president india likes address the reporters press room casual manner the rashtrapathi bhavan and always there are refreshments and such provided the journalists when abdul kalam was the president had one such event went for about minutes and they were about wind kalam had noticed that there were couple coffee cups plates strewn around lying the floor near the journalists chairs promptly asked all the journos clean behind them and added you see was teacher first and will always one think this class exercise and realize that there nothing demeaning about cleaning after oneself should also add that sometimes people not know exactly how they can contribute when you ask for people participation keep our country clean some may not know how contribute and many may not even realize the effects their actions how plastic bags are strewn around this picture give them solid task and you can expect them think duty modi could have just asked our indian citizens present there today clean after themselves what little extent they can and then perhaps these kids might have got teach kids values give people specifics about how contribute also anecdote involving abdul kalam when was the president ,1
how nobody pointing out that modi well known fascist who endorsed and encouraged genocidal mobs against muslims the gujarat riots listen someone who has gone through sexual violence course want world leaders speak the issue but not world leaders that facilitate genocide sorry but the selective praise here really disturbing ,-1

 “ want ask parents when your daughter turns years old you ask ‘where are you going when will you return ’ the parents dare ask their sons ‘where are you going why are you going who are your friends ’ after all the rapist also someone’ son only parents decide put many restrictions their sons they their own daughters ” think worth noting that has made choice here girls are restricted and boys are not chooses promote the restriction boys addition the current restrictions girls rather than promote the idea that girls should unrestricted boys know major source tension between east and west conservative and liberal the amount freedoms women are allowed civil society bikinis burkhas far charting paths for nation following through his campaign promises the conservative voters that ushered him into power return values stronger national image personally glad used his first speech speak against this behavior and not saying wrong position himself conservative social reformer but certainly worth noting see his party start implement actual policy the days ahead ,1

great now americans could have leader who would recognize and work solve our facto but yet unaddressed problems ,1
finally indian born and raised america never understood why india never addressed this head when spoke about these occurences relatives months ago their responses all circled the position not letting their daughters out all that was the mindset not only relatives but many politicians well the mindset needed change starting from the top modi ran efficient and amazing campaign for his position which resulted his landslide victory but attack this issue early his term good hear was truly scared for india country where such grotesque events were norm props modi ,1

 these indians rape because they believe they have right treat woman object due lack education mostly because they believe males can act they see fit while women must know their place with that many people raping has cultural thing mean gang rapes seriously what the percentage gang raped compared 1v1 rape ,1
 would easier believe modi rhetoric weren abusing his power save rape enablers from his own base course maybe doesn count when the victim not hindu two weeks ago courts the prime minister home state where was chief minister for more than decade and where his party and clique dominate politics let maya kodnani out bail ece ,1
americas rape statistics aren much better ,1
 confused after asking previous thread why indian culture has such problem with rape was told bunch reddit sociologists that there particular problem with the indian culture and were just hearing lot about some particularly bad stories massive upvotes were had many maybe this should think about consulting with the experts here reddit before makes any further reckless statements about indian culture ,-1
yeah leadership ,0
does anyone else feel like this ridiculous the vatican denies priest molestation for long when the new pope finally steps forward and says that not right supposed along with now the first indian leader wants address problem that plagued india for while and were just supposed say now gets fuck that the common people have been taken advantage for too long time demanded the same human rights that given all mankind not just the american canadian european arabian rich and influential and whoever else thinks themselves too good part the human race ,1
 needs talk about real issues india rapists gonn rape regardless,1
stupid war criminal giving speech about the scourge rape and violence ,-1

well can know the individual kids involved but can find out the schools these kids and shame them the schools the internet and other media into volunteering their students into clean drives around their neighborhoods armchair redditor that the best can this particular case ,1
why would only major prominence now everyone knows about ,1
 really hope this doesn get buried but few army buddies and myself have began put together non profit organization that would deal specifically with combating the rape epidemic plaguing india all wouldn mind just checking out our site and see anything worth your while all don mind hearing more have multimedia campaign and variety different approaches self defense that will only decrease the amount crimes like rape assault and robberies this account was created bit spontaneously but all want with questions about sponsorship job opportunities right ahead ,1
another less emphasized part this article modi also used his speech speak out against the practice indian family’ selectively aborting females the woman abandoning female babies once they’ born earlier this week the indian government announced that the sex ration among children — standing 927 girl children per 000 boys — the lowest ’ been since india’ independence 1947 ,-1
 not everyone was pleased with modi’ speech however members the indian national congress were less than impressed with the scope modi offered overall his speech “given that was the first address the new prime minister one would have expected certain vision articulated him the trajectory the next five years ” party spokesperson and former minister manish tewari said “but unfortunate that got bogged down pedestrian issues without being able rise the occasion ” pedestrian issues what does tewari consider not pedestrian issue this pedestrian ,1
yeah one was talking about rape until heard this brave speech ,1
maybe part the problem the very high rates female infanticide india the selective abortion female fetuses that been going for the last years maybe the men are rapey because there actual shortage women and maybe the whole dialogue needs include the entire spectrum indian attitudes towards women from dowries class systems sex and better law enforcement for crimes against women ,1
good move modi ,1

 dont think one cannot expect him understand neither scientist nor doc have engineers who believe homeopathy why single narendra out for very common our country ,-1
how disappointing homeopathy load bullshit not surprised though growing always heard parents and relatives talk about and just thought was medicine wasn later until looked and realized how much bullshit ,-1
 one step forward and two steps back you cant cure cancer with just placebo you know this just sad ,-1
 well that let down against modi for this ,-1
 think this just symptom much larger problem with indian society most not all will probably have least one friend family member who believes homeopathy india lot educated people including people scientific background believe not surprising that our believes legitimate what necessary that such contested beliefs should not affect policy for instance homeopathy should not promoted officially the government for anything more than minor incurable ailments where application homeopathy placebo theory will not cause any harm ,-1
one the basic tenets this science called homeopathy about dilution leads direct contradiction with basic results chemistry not surprising therefore that the scientific community considers quackery the same time heard from many different sources that homeopathic medicine itself has helped cure diseases like chronic allergies asthma etc ,1
 not really fazed this news most our people believe our govt bestowed one the highest honors the nation homeopath why should surprised that our new believes ,1
you know who doesn support homeopathy kejriwal ,0

 there should not question conflict between allopathy ayurveda and homeopathy all the three systems treatment have some best things them said chief minister said that homeopathic medicines prove very effective the case teething children seen that the irritating teething process makes children extremely weak and malnourished would great service the homeopathy can used for keeping strong the immune system child during teething process and thus preventing children from malnutrition regarding this appealed homeopathy association launch drive for curbing malnutrition some context would good its not like anti modern science unlike our kulcha who anti alternate medicine alternate medicine working for some who are force them stop using whatever happened freedom choice only applicable when suits our ideological propaganda ,1
 think homeopathy doesn hurt sure has some benefits but cannot replace medicine homeopathy probably does have long term benefits should encouraged because very economical for india and has side effects why not ,1

 know the current science says bullshit but thing works for and everyone family when was had chronic joint pain that refused away for months after using homeopathic remedy the effect was immediate there was gradual reduction pain within hours and week gone completely have used homeopathic remedies for many other things after that and the results were more than satisfactory another thing want say the current science doesn have explanation for everything have explored nothing also big pharma the big mafia downvote this all you want but just wanted share experience ,1

 listing alleged incidents meerut faizabad and ghaziabad bajpai said “have they got the certificate rape girls because they belong particular religion ” what load horseshit guess most notorious rape cases this country were all from these religiously licensed communities right sure why can the population commit the rapes that sounds legit man the level which these bigots will for votes and politics has fucking limits making issues like sexual harassment and rape religious one the lowest form politics one can play but then again what can you expect from this fucking toad bjp can survive without anti muslim rhetoric they need hindu votes and hindus can unite internally unlike muslims they probably are too busy give shit which good getting them hate each other all they have got all this development and vibrant nonsense will crystal clear next 5yrs and they fully aware which point divide and conquer will and has worked best they know ,1
this saddening hear again and again they are slowly demonizing the whole muslim community gain votes and get into power why the fuck can they stick the development mantra and read this know about who were raped and who got sheltered ,-1
this hopeless bigotry will live and continue keep sections society apart since when rape religious problem have there been recorded rapes from hindu communities and panchayats divisive rhetoric like this will get you votes the short term but will absolutely fracture unity the long term why can they simply stick accomplishments and policies ,1
what kind sick fucks exist this country who are willing look the other way when the ruling entity the country blatantly labeling whole religion rapists based the crimes few really are you that blind did you not get educated look people people and not members ascribing faith what poor faculty tolerance and then they act all miffed when you lament that the country isn improving mind you all bad the hindu muslim murderers and rapists who believe okay kill people based who they worship just because your bigotry hasn reduced barbaric violence now doesn mean never will fact means there much higher chance you being the first people join violent movement against some other religion sick fucktards the entire lot you and don give that shit about having holier than thou attitude normal you the unevolved barbaric hordes living way out the time when the majority the population was like you ,-1
this good way they now are upfront about what they stand for sneaky agenda packaged with other bigger idea like search toolbar addons also wonder what modi thinks about this strategy wait remember this just footpath politics nevermind ,1

 what find funny women hitwomen make bombs bengal and who are the vanguard other such jihadi completely ignored most people would like condemn this too but the time they land the thread there already strong sentiment against seculars building the top comments are generally all low effort comments pushing political agenda rather than profound comment thus they bullied and taunted even they comment they get downvoted almost immediately guess this what drives them away from commenting ,1
primary reason for this that india divided between sickulars pseudo seculars khangressi sanghis chaddis bhakts rightwingers most people each side address the other want honest debate the name calling has stop and you are much guilty this the next guy seen you asking where the secu liberals are many threads recently that support your political viewpoint just shifts the focus from the content ideological shitfest even may guilty extent heck even feel that the sole purpose most users submitting these links put down the other side rather than have meaningful discussion edit grammar,1

 supposed appreciate and praise this guy curse him like two face says and does some amazing things and promptly does volte face and says shit diggy raja would proud while the vaiko and jaya circlejerked seems out there getting things done good stuff indeed ,1
 think some the stupid shit that swamy says deliberate that his awesomeness keeps getting dismissed everyone with every raja kanimozhi jaya that goes jail with every sonia rahul daamadji that has uncomfortable fire lit under their asses for fraud with every fisherman saved with every black rupee that comes back india smarter people first and then more impressionable people will realize who serving the interests india you people really should try and give him shot not because needs has shown many times how much patience has fight individual battles but that you pay proportionate importance words actions ,-1
 think the battle rages gadkari hand may behind this intentional instability one can dismiss that possibility the battle yet end and few months after that that the dust will settle and give clarity until then bad for bjp since going polls few other states where potential allies will put off this dirty public linen ,-1

politically masterstroke can only think caesar outwitting his opponents who came with blocks his career every other way wrong not the fucking ncp wish they had the balls fail the floor test and gone for reelections they would have held the moral high ground the least maybe even come back with thumping majority understand real politik and all but thikn all voted for party that was not the fucking congress shenanigan like this remind indira india cannot believe they might have cut deal with fucking sharad corruption pawar also how stable will the govt chacha will hold fadnavis his gonads threatening instability best even now relinquish for reelections ,-1
brilliant you must kidding this not statesmanship this brinkmanship bjp has just shot itself the foot big time not being accommodating long time partner one thing humiliating them cocking snook them and making them look like idiots entirely another thing and bjp just ended doing the latter god save them they don work out their skins some dazzling work the next years anything they painted themselves into corner now and use cricketing analogy they have now score century every innings they play the next years they don deliver even give the impression that they haven delivered they are toast years time this what happened bjp taka albeit under somewhat different circumstances and even pan indian modi wave could not save them yeddi with all his scandals could bring taka bjp its knees and lasting harm sure can worse few more months year brinkmanship from the bjp and mns will forced ally together then you have escapees and asylum seekers from ncp and cong crossing over instead using this opportunity finish off least the cong and ncp keeping close closer don corleone would say the bjp have let themselves get carried away delusions grandeur state politics are entirely different cup tea from national politics modi shah will deluded think they won the war they have best won round cross border fire skirmish fadnavis modi and there only much modi can actively coach from the sidelines while also doing his day job the country billion people seriously get the feeling that bjp going find out few things the hard way ,1
 congress mlas suspended from maharashtra assembly for years hahaha ,1
not even half brilliant evil sharad pawar basically played everyone the state like fiddle whilst his very lowest anyone won this fight was him this what had work with the biggest anti incumbency factor recent history party reputation tatters even lower than congress state leader the most hated man the state significantly reduced personal clout this what did pleased his core constituency marathas lot even before the centre elections and made sure too many them won over the bjp broke away from the congress and became extremely quiet till the election killing lot birds with one stone ncp could wrest some seats away from congress get great position chum with bjp hurt and mns breaking marathi votes and give themselves the best chance retain many seats they can they got which amazing given they were looking total rout after the election offered bjp unconditional support right the outset and became the towel their waist the condom their dick and this completely took bargaining chip away from them since bjp now had out bet correctly being rigid idiots and bjp being calculating assholes and the discussions failing utterly put the bjp power abstaining this the result they rode away from what should have been their execution with their core intact cong like the ottomans 1919 now its open season them his personal relations with their leaders means ncp prime position free grab whatever they can especially rss starts pushing their influence too much bet ranes atleast will interested looks like breaking there too proved can take care his friends now even his weakest played huge role destroying the saffron alliance don think non maha people will appreciate what incredible feat this was bjp have been through rougher times and never looked they will break ncp basically played iago better than laurence oliver ian mckellan and ken branaugh put together bjp are now minority govt and knows who they have thank for they even hint going big ncp people adarsh irrigation scams and pawar will pull the rug bjp will satisfied going after cong and some designated ncp scapegoats and everything will alright mns and raj utterly finished again another huge achievement but raj himself helped out lot regardless status quo preserved there 5th party the state now and the guy who was most openly against pawar and maratha appeasement projects like shivaji statue and reservations now silenced this bit pure speculation completely back formation vidarbha which fadnavis pet project this makes his people marathas even more dominant the remaining part maha rashtra and once bjp sheen wears off completely won have wait long either the sule pawars will back ruling the state fucking sun tsu could not have done better take bow cancer faced bastard maintain this guy one the biggest political geniuses the country apart from being great administrator and amazing diplomat weren for his out control personal ambition have been modi before modi still wonder what would have happened had become instead narsimha rao that ambition part would have been satisfied long ago would like frank underwood becoming sect state like wanted right the start season ,1

 just take one thing from the speech that that our wants focus north east india and make them important and integral part our country you have seen how most the citizens our country treat our fellow citizens from the north east out siders you will understand that this has become very important and uses reference religious text emphasise the importance the area see problem have majority hindus this nation least the population hindu and these start treating north east with respect because sighted religious text not see anything wrong with secondary note any you have read the vastu shastra you will realise based more science than religion just keep mind when you read that was based science technology and common sense for people living more than 1000 years ago,1

the magni uber now default recommended amp that crazy power for ,-1
cool getting the modi uber for valhalla couldn justify spending more the bifrost when never used dac this good news for thanks for the heads ,1
 looks like asgard and bifrost next for upgrades ,0
these look pretty cool think little down the road get magni uber and modi run both speakers and headphones through that pretty good value ,1
what ohm ratings are these good for getting some 32ohm headphones and plan just using stereo amp for them which 8ohm would benefit from the school stack ,1
aww schiitt ,1
holy crap the modi uber like smaller cheaper xda without the volume control and not many inputs glad see some companies making dacs with more than one input ,-1
how would this stack compare fiio e17 ive got the fiio but have been reasonably unimpressed with the results ,1
they put gain switch now exactly like the ,1
was the warranty always two years that new thought was year before ,1
anyone else feel like this brand overrated bit head has contract with them that forces the mods delete any negetive threads about the product head html just sounds kinda shady ,-1
the product faq mentions the difference between the standard and uber versions but doesn really delve into the differences between the old and the new versions what has been updated ,1
from dac perspective the modi uber what was looking for far connectivity goes probably pulling the trigger this ,1
 where does this leave the asgard seems like the magni uber more powerful and significantly smaller than its bigger brother ,1
 modi magni the new wonder combo modi uber and magni uber the new wonder combo and asgard bifrost being the new wonder combo modi uber magni uber think are going standard recommendation now edit not sure why being downvoted here modi magni were standard recommendation unless you needed more features then asgard bifrost were its well known what recommendations have been you read headphones ,1
and just bought audioengine ,0
damn now sitting here super jealous with month old magni modi set anyone wanna buy for close what paid lol,1
these guys have revisions faster than iphones,0
 schiit ,0
 don need these all but they are very well designed makes want them ,1
could someone eli5 what the practical difference are read the thread and still bit confused,-1
they back and forth happening with companies the low end great for everyone glad schiit made new revision want all the companies fight over who the budget king least they stuck gain switch the thing watts into ohms that beyond silly ,1
regarding not announcing the relevant info ,1
now directly competing with odac instead undercutting them you know schiit operating with business strategy that defies common business paradigms first most businesses first sell expensive product and use help build cheaper product that they market larger consumer base the logic that the halo effect the exclusive product will help drive sales the cheaper mass market for example light harmonic leveraged the aura their davinci dac for geek contrast schiit started with cheap schiit and worked its way the niche expensive stuff second while original designs tend complicated especially electronics they tend get simpler products iteratively evolve through generations again schiit the opposite although fair certain aspects the schiit business model does make lot sense offer base model and then rather than reinventing ghr wheel add features subsequent generations improve profit because you can charge premium for the added features for example auto companies this all the time staggering convertible models year two after they launch the sedan coupe and they are very savvy about marketing which again isn surprising given jason background ,1
 was planning picking the magni modi this week glad didn ,1
 just ordered nfb15 should see can cancel and get magni modi uber stack ,0
well just recieved old schiit stack which ordered monday what missing out ,-1
does uber have hardware mixer ,0
 assuming the original magni and modi drop price used markets they are still very worthy upgrade don really care about gain switch ,1
whats the difference between the regular magni and the uber edition ,0
 looking run sennheiser 600s these there any benefit sound with the uber magni modi versions over the regular magni modi ,1
god damn just bought magni modi few months ago really want get the magni just for that gain switch having constantly keep magni the lowest volume really annoying ,-1
stupid question but get just modi uber and magni can power set speakers like the audioengine ,-1
 schiit magni modi combo just arrived ,0
how would connect iphone source the dac the dac already plugged into the amp ,0
now the magni uber something can use ,0
asgard came yesterday bifrost comes tomorrow really excited also this hobby expensive balls ,-1
once again find stuff intriguing but also intrigued the decisions ,1
should get fulla these,0
this pretty noob ish question but now seems appropriate time ask there significant difference between the output the pre amp and line level output ask because have audio interface that has good dac and have intention replacing however only has line out ideally like able switch between headphone amp and integrated amp without bypassing the integrated pre amp without having switch cables would going from pre amp output the magni into normal line level input integrated amp issue other than having third volume knob adjust ,1
what the frick frank anybody want buy vali stack ,0
 support for 384 dsd into the trash goes ,0
 currently running first gen magni modi but might consider upgrade pair uber some amount time have powered speakers desk the preamp out magni uber would very helpful right now just moving cables back and forth and the multiple input the modi would allow solve the same issue with and ps3 usb from and optical from ps3 can imagine there perceptible difference audio quality but the extra ports would very useful guess just have decide convenience really worth should just wait until get some much nicer headphones and then upgrade higher end amp ,1

yes your key point very sensible however you too are prejudiced and biased looking your own commentary counter questions about similar practices other religions you make valid point that false equivalency countering similar practices other religion way deflect the question recent examples include the charles hebdo incident where every single person india and very rightly condemned the attack however when rss and bjp members harass author into pulping his books there appears condemnation for the hindu right aren you doing the same thing which you accuse others doing you are using false equivalency and countering rss bjp narrative with charlie hebdo example you want the discussion limited critique hinduism without the use deflections giving examples other regions the same logic limit charlie hebdo massacre discussion what attack radicalized muslims not compare with bjp rss activities they are not the same category all ,1
some people believe that you criticize your own religion the absolute worst thing have often spoken here well real life when people wrong things the name religion and have been branded traitor agnostic atheist and paper jain egs speak against loudspeakers being used during ganesh chaturti get the you speak now when hindu festival but why not during eid arguments times basically cannot criticise own religion and want have criticise all religions otherwise anti hindu often times have been critical about jainism and its recent mutation into intolerant religion from peaceful tolerant one and have been branded traitor this irl the way many relatives and acquaintances they are quick point out that why not speak about other religions too often wondered about this and its always puzzled why have such mentality think the root cause lies the fact that not like being told what the problems are are too proud and not want others point out whats wrong home deep down know and make ourselves feel better sit and point out the problems with other religions and most the times the elders and the spiritual gurus and sadhus often use fear tactics quell such critics from their own home from speaking out they use social punishments like banishing one from the community and labeling people traitors this cents from own experiences such labels have not stopped and never will the argument that cannot criticise own religion bogus don need criticise others just criticise own ,1
this also reminds this twice gilded comment that probably the top comment any post here said however views india any india studies class the from bottom approach starting from problems indian society treatment women dalits religious minorities ascribes these problems hinduism and hindu theology caste system hindu patriarchy upper caste chauvinism which considered the fundamental block indian nationalism hindutva wars against pakistan and the indian state constitution government etc vast majority this sub completely agreed with this appraisal however nobody noticed the hypocrisy are viewing islam and islamic countries the same way ,1
 agree with noticed myself and whenever comment something religious have remind myself that mention something that wrong with hinduism have somehow bring the evils islam christianity otherwise get snark about secularism ,-1
well hinduism has been historically open change many rituals and customs 18th and 19th century have been outlawed are now obsolete still evolving abrahmic religions the other hand still justify pedophilia polygamy stoning kuffar killing and other monstrosities suggest keeping track posts and comments that bring commonplace regressive hindu light india sure you will surprised ,1
hypocrisy thy name india ,0
 there was call for reform hinduism then the caste system wouldn dying sati would still exist etc hinduism continuously reforming you are just too blind see ,-1
" think when comes general religiosity and adherence holy books hindus are fairly low down the order nobody here gonna defend dogmatists within the hindu religion the examples you cite are not really clear cut the ritual probably not encouraged today context but back then was simply not rape had child marriages the only form marriage the past but have moved from that and now consider social evil wrong right not absolute and has seen context also regarding the tamil novel you simply don know what you are talking about the problem more related casteism and libel than free speech now not suggesting free speech not factor this case but means the only factor lastly lot people criticize today islam because the literalist manner practiced lot people very regressive and outmoded belief system reformers within the community should ideally step forward but they are silenced via the religion itself non muslims affected will only naturally end criticizing then least they aren inhibited notice how similar criticisms are not made for any other religion also this means just indian phenomenonh
",1
 malayalee guessing the nayars mentioned the article which doesn seem have any sources are whom know nairs don know any nairs who have such ritual their culture spoken two nair friends about both whom thought was making shit and here you are painting all hinduism with one broad brush probably dipped the same virgin blood the article talks but why does one talk about this hindu can take criticism etc etc probably because the article full shit lol this fucking thread people having shitfit over vague article that doesn seem clarify anything ,-1
 yet one seems reflect this practice but the post littered with crass humour this what most people here resort when they see something insult their favourite dharma their bharatmata their favourite politician you can read leela sampson being referred bitch here just because she dared pass and most people here hated the fact then foreign correspondent once wrote article slightly critical modi and yet again the right wing here bombarded her with abuses when rape gets reported from india the energy this sub channeled into how the fault worldnews for picking rape news stories from india you should understand the demographic the right wing the people who call others anti hindu and sickular their ego carries sense superiority accrued twice once when they are told how their religion the best and the second time about their caste being the most noble when they are exposed fact which strikes theose delusions their instinct label the other person jholachaap question his intentions anti hindu anti india perfect example who also the personal hero many here subramanium swamy ,1
 charlie not charles ,0
 the yardstick modern wingnuts and their counterparts from half century ago ambedkar was anti hindu too you should proud find yourself such esteemed company instead worrying about how wingnuts will perceive you ,1
 hope this doesn make pro hindu because don have lot with religion begin with having said that heres something for you ponder about you compared the killing humans bullying one person which definitely wrong well okay worries from north and dont know lot about speaking forced penetrations not sure how forced that its ritual for them which practiced specific community south would ignorant would like bina jane gyaan baantna but how are these forced penetrations different from forced circumcision why does forced circumcision spread across the world abrahamic religions not bother you are you sexist sir everything that fucks decent human life wrong doesn matter what religion that practice belongs the fact that you were able make the observation that you posted shows that you have bias well and suggestion for you would work that ,-1
tbh don think its problem with hinduism and hindus indian issue are incapable debating rationally and see criticism personal attack you say something bout hindus met with something worse about islam and why that not being criticized you say something about india people will say something bad about iran some other place and say india better than that say something bad about tendulkar and the response you get but but what about dravid who blah blah made that but see very deep seated resentment india when comes criticising their own yes and applies everything not just religion and applies indians general not just india,-1
 think the ills hinduism well documented the intelligentsia there isn one person here who not willing accept that some the practices are regressive the problem that the criticism the religion has become pervasive that the ones doing have become blind the ills other communities there way radicalization the minority community compared forced penetration but our intelligentsia for long time has thought and still thinks that casteism the mother all evils and need inherently ashamed our religion classic case throwing the baby along with the bathwater what they have failed consistently apply the logic other communities corollary that frustrated people see the posts critical hinduism and think well what new here knew this and made feel ashamed hey look the muslims circumcise but they maintain the secular fabric the nation has gone the extent that need create saffron terror more recently censor board reaction and msg most people take the internet highlight the inconsistency dealing with criticism religion ,-1
frankly don even get your logic the practice described that link yours sure nobody modern times have seen first ask you get people who seen firsthand and then let criticise all you want short was moronic post that caught attention only jokes ,1
hindus have belief that hinduism very very different from other religions and that lacks most evils other religions this could the result being juxtaposed with extreme sides islam under the mughals and after that for long long time regardless believe this has led hindus feel that hinduism infallible conversations with parents have all ended with them either being hindu apologists just flat denying the wrong that exists last conversation here with individual where tried argue that india isn backward because islamic presence resulted being called muslim with the person deciding that the only way could prove non religious nature atheist was each posted pornographic images muhammad and his daughter and hindu deities not that care too much about the religious pornography but was too stunned the lack maturity general civility that suggestion ,-1
atheist here and hindu don like call myself culturally hindu because frankly don like much and that was the first thing that came mind yes digressed from posting about that that post didn want create shitstorm ,1
hindus here and elsewhere seem have totally forgotten that the caste system still exists and that inherently unjust and barbaric heck even urban educated upper caste hindus wont marry loe caste dalit imagine the situation some tiny ass bihar village all religious people know have holier than thou attitude where they never ever acknowledge their own faults but chide others for theirs whichever way you look hinduism has major caste problem ehich refuses away and you are doubt tell your dad that you are marrying dalit girl then report his response here better still try being lower caste and enter temple some small bihar village ,1
 the proverbial straw that broke the camel back would this post sack bricks and has found the usual hindu haters whine along from the post that triggered this outpouring frequently symbolic defloration satisfied the requirements the reform pretentiously seeks has already happened ,1
 jain and honestly dont give shit dont get wrong think healthy discussion relgious topics essential call out obviiously stupid rituals antics people out cheat gullible people just that dont find myself being interested such discssions maybe its coz view more fatalistic religion just another way people group themselves every civilization and yeah thats including western nations groups itself amonst commonly held beliefs have strong opinions about those who dont believe their set values its trait any civilization and will present some form the other kill this there will something that will take its place there escaping you will always grouped into something whether you like not and you will possess some beliefs and characteristics that will offensive disagreeable wrongful the other person whether those beliefs are right wrong subjective and therefore can never been categorized into right wrong ,-1
you know hate when topic regarding hinduism islam and christianity make guest appearances this sub has many users who are either pseculars right wingers balanced discussion hard come yes islam needs reforms but does hinduism comparatively hinduism might more progressive than islam but doesn mean should lenient when barbaric activities like the defloration ceremony takes place hinduism not perfect one may hide behind but what about muslims when any criticism hinduism comes but doesn really change anything hope people stop comparing religions when specific discussion carried out about particular religion and talk about what wrong and what could done about the problems agnostic couldn care less about any religion but please islam needs reforms reminds this mods why did you delete the post regarding islamic reforms saying doesn concern india and does hinduism not comparing them the quantum reforms needed are different but yes discussions even hinduism should balanced edit added word ,-1

 however when rss and bjp members harass author into pulping his books there appears condemnation for the hindu right but many comments appear that justify harassment freedom expression equally outrageous the comments from the opposite ends the spectrum that justifies freedom libel slander freedom expression somebody had threatened murugan there absolutely defence for they need booked under relevant sections the law that however doesnt mean murugan had the right assosciate real world community fictious slanderous ritual and not expect those slandered pursue legal means redress the situation also dont know where you got the pulping the book the latest seems has agreed remove the portions the book associating the women with the fictious ritual and ahead and bjp rss werent the main protestors even the original protests were the kongu vellala koundars whose community women were portrayed negative way was only later that the hindu munnani joined them and perhaps you are not aware the actual flow events fyi regarding the floration few redditors from the nair community the community that was mentioned practising this have mentioned they havent even heard this valid question what separates libel from freedom speech are supposed defend libel under the defence constitutes freedom speech would like you clarify that ,1
completely agree regarding the ritual defloration understand that applies specifically tamils and again specifically the tamils traditional enough have coming age ceremony some don and again those who actually allow the priest conduct this ritual who assuming the minority many hibdus treat something that other and not part hinduism per but yes there are tons problems with hinduism and this sub reddit answers any criticism with look what the muslims are doing sickular which isn right must learn accept what dole out and don think comparing ourselves the muslims going make any better ,1
great post would add economic theory angle nda upa there was very public spat between jagdish bhagwati and amartya sen recently whether gujarat development model good one bad the red side amartya sen who has been proponent improving social indicators education illiteracy bottom approach sorts reckons that once people become more skilled they will start contributing the economy and accelerate growth the blue side jagdish bhagwati who has been proponent policies aimed accelerating growth reckons that acceleration growth will increase government revenues which can then used improve the quality life the peoples you look where nda and upa take their inspiration when comes economic policies then becomes obvious that nda more towards jagdish bhagwati and upa more towards amartya sen basically comes down choose your poison choose nda not because economic genius who thinks one better than the other its just that have tried one and has failed for nearly years lets give the other side chance ,1
 formatted all the tables thanks vim anyway copy your post and will delete the comment every second day there thread why educated people support that fount communal poison the bjp instead all endlessly circle jerking over subjective stuff wanted take slightly different approach and put forth some key macro economic indicators that compare data from nda era and the upa regimes even plotted graphs excel but imgur won allow upload excel graphs and have idea how upload these onto reddit otherwise ideas welcome also how does one make tables reddit copy pasting from excel again does not work the data indicator nda upa upa agriculture industry services gdp growth rates nothing much choose from though the upa seems have done well across all sectors how this achieved will cover little later indicator nda upa upa cad cad the upa performance looks horrible one could attribute increasing oil prices touched peak 100 barrel certain extent but only portion why the cad went down horribly indicator nda upa upa inflation wpi inflation cpi inflation seems have been horribly mismanaged the upa and this largely due deficit financing and pumping huge funds into the rural sector the form mnrega the mnrega was the larger picture actually bad for the intended recipients drove prices over and hurt the economy whole indicator nda upa upa fiscal deficit again how did the upa achieve the funding such profligate schemes such mnrega the food safety act the loan waiver deficit financing essentially spent more which govts usually more than what earned this also has the side effect fueling inflation and now come why believe even these numbers are illusionary absolute increase employment nda upa agriculture manufacturing non manufacturing services total the net jobs added the nda years compared the upa data for 2013 was not available not even comparable and this why believe the upa growth was illusory jobless growth factor the million unemployed people hitting our workforce every year and imperative that nation find jobs for all them another factor would have liked compare but data not available prior 2008 will leave out scope but just mention this the indicator gross fixed capital formation infrastructure the nda well know focussed lot infrastructure roads and the highway network being chief amongst these the nda added more roads years than years other governments combined without the govt massively investing actual infrastructure job creation and economic growth going difficult manage this not new either the upa mismanagement indira gandhi did pretty much the same thing she created import fueled bubble illusory growth that broke very quickly and fueled massive inflation windows opportunity memoirs economic adviser krishnaswamy goes into detail into how indira almost wrecked the national economy recklessly devaluing the currency and sending inflation soaring the late indira also established the trend socialistic economy not her father who piloted mixed economy ruthlessly nationalising every industry from coal banking wheat and imposing draconian restrictions the private sector indira also failed focus infrastructure and during her first regime cut down investment infrastructure after nehru who did very well guide the indian economy given his set challenges every succeeding gandhi dynast has been absolute disaster for the national economy the problem the gandhi congress way has now caught and almost every major party follows the same dead approach populsim throwing sops during election time and forgetting about even basic economics subjective opinion bjp see party that serious about building infrastructure that serious about creating jobs that while populist marries this populism with sense pragmatism arguably the only party right now that sees merit manufacturing being the workhorse the indian economy see how the bjp method has worked relative india course places like chatisgarh gujarat goa yes has failed karnataka yet has the resilience learn and apply lessons and not just throw some dynast scion continue the same tired old politics sloganeering empty tokenism and sops all won work without some hard reforms and this something the bjp has established track record and this why support the bjp source for the data the planning commission php data datatab edit seriously cross heart and hope die pinky swear level don care about points and self post doesn even give any points but seconds after posted this was wonder being brigaded the namo army edit somebody please tell how draw tables upload graphs here the post looks messy without tables ,-1
excellent effort thanks for the post was big fan the nda govt because was when was india and aware interested politics and their policies seemed make sense not sure some things can ever quantified your analysis 2008 recession for mostly because economics are not forte also did the sanctions that came after the nuclear tests have any effect ,1
 add some context most economies except are struggling the moment there massive that holding the similar efforts are also being made europe japan and china but have far had little success most currencies have lost massively against the but inr has held brazil was considered india peer and its economy the dumps and russia are struggling well though russia can blame some its tussle with nato ukraine the midst all this india stands tall you look the sensex its been going pretty steadily ever since became clear that modi was going come power oil crash has certainly helped the economy but the rise started much before that the criticism from some sections the society will continue matter how modi performs but doesn matter the big picture since the majority firmly behind modi the guy has the drive confidence and ability take our country forward fiis will continue pour money based fundamentals modi agenda was development and can already see solid results less than year ,1

 doubt upa did not manage the finances properly but the inflation during upa1 was also partly due the prevailing market conditions where rbi had for omo purchases which effect led inflation rbi reportedly bought bonds close 6lac crores during the period 2008 2013 but the indiscretion showed upa further worsened ,-1

 with raghu raj this one the fact that the bjp views manufacturing instigator growth not plus point ,0
inconclusive view time the best judge can really compare the post era this simplistically there was massive growth and movement the mid late because the level from which things started was low congress being historically center left party has always had socialist tendencies chose use the funds give freebies the section which was less developed vote banks etc the expense pumping that money into sectors such are infra health etc india not rich the mid india entire gdp was less than defense budget can spend use its money everything has prioritize congress choose what did only time will tell how right wrong they were when compared what comes after them current govt will also have prioritize because india while longer equal defense budget numbers still pretty poor terms its revenue can just pump money into everything and make things everywhere right that just not going happen ,1
you can make tables last control above the text box thanks for the post feel the same way the social side bjp make want throw but economics and defence national security where the degree patriotism actually measured there comparison the bjp least far seem run adults who understand economics while the congress full with some exceptions either traitors idiots ,-1

 just want point out case one mentioned looks like the how gear going take everyone light instead tdb where you were with raid armor that became obsolete overnight with the base armor being released basically you were maxed with tdb raid armor then you don have buy rank all new armor you just need the raid get upgraded raid gear rank ,-1
omg that armor this turns out fake bungie needs hire this person because skills while glad bungie has announced that the new armor for how won make the crota end raid gear obsolete going swap out for the new stuff this legit ,1

first legendary ever was pox volo wondered why was the only one using pulse rifle then learned the sad truth let rewrite that truth shall how all about high impact excited ,1
 someone knows how could they reformat this imgur gallery would greatly appreciated ,1
 what suppose untill may 19th ,0
may have wait until may for this dlc already out shit this game now have wait over months for something new this better not true,-1
can wait for raid shoes ,0
anyone else find strange that the gear starts light level surely this can right ,1
how was this done just changing the date your console may something ,0
 looks like all did was change the system date has anyone else tried this since someone used this view history xur inventory ,0
 hundreds meaning mostly new uncommon and rares that don have uses for ,1
 thought and sorry can source this right now they were raising the cap might hallucinating haven had full cup joe yet ,1
super depressing see that once again the vendors will make raid armor obsolete soon the dlc drops ,-1
looks like going start farming marks all characters and commendations grind the vendor gear goodbye set you missed starting 6am release date ,0
rofl looks like the queen should let shoot those fallen the reef when she had the chance well ,1
with the obligatory grain salt not sure why people are looking that new pulse rifle and chanting yay pulse rifles are getting fixed looks like the impact rating that gun par with the pre tdb super pox vlo sold the vanguard even with the high impact that gun making the best pulse rifle the game that time imo was still annoyingly under powered ,1
 guess tdb build contained placeholder dates for how the data hoping they are place holder difficult enough hold fireteam interest raiding right now with the expectation week wait month wait will kill this game bungie really need get response out for this one ,-1
not really liking the warlock helmets well usually have exotic that slot anyway the rest the armor looks good hopefully both sides the coat are intact what got for tdb pretty bad all for tatters but don rip off entire side the titan stuff alright again not liking the helmets the real question here why hunters get all the cool armor seriously the helmet gauntlets vest everything all looks amazing blood splatters may have finally make hunter when this releases ,1
this can legit the vendor gear for warlocks doesn look like hobo rags ,0
great post thanks can you post pictures the vanguard titan armor also please ,1
thank you deej for posting but dont think thats what are getting would like know the date the dlc thats the real kicker ,1
that scout rifle with field scout,0
 going pissed off you can purchase vendor gear that beats the best gear seriously did they not learn from their mistakes with tbd ,1
 issue with this that have wait months for what basically raid some story missions and some crucible maps will never play opinion know some people enjoy crucible and months mean since the precious expansion which was only raid some story missions and some crucible maps for any citizens payed £ for both these the dark below was fairly lackluster expansion far expansions and lot was just textured stuff which seemed lazy know this seems like dissapointed with the game because content lol kind rant but more with what paying comparison what getting bought the season expansion pass very early because was naive about the game course still going check out the content but for that money could bought whole game what the new expansion seems key word seems running the information have heard offering the same the previous new weps armor missions and raid which for £ the price without expansion pass just doesn seem worth that much feel like paying for bigger grind genuinely hope this isn the case enjoy the game extent but only extent can burn out this game quickly now avoid playing too much now hope how invigorates love for the game edit1 shoutout for this post btw good finds ,1
 the only one getting tired all the warlock cloaks being tattered messes ,-1
blood spattered hunter armor looks bad ass ,-1
wait did just keep setting his ps4 date forward until got these things glitch ,0
this stuff looks fucking sweet compared the dark below stuff,1
man hope they release how march because starting finally hit wall this game there are also some major new games releasing the spring and summer and much love this game time move without extra content ,-1
that scout rifle looks badass,0
would nice because not too much want know should save marks for next dlc buy stuff now ,1
see new pulse rifle feel scalp tingle time ,1
hunter confirmed master race with the blood all you other peasants its armor,1
 not fussed about weapons and armor there will always good weapons use and collect whatever armor takes higher light levels what interests about this post are the supposed release date later than expected true and the story from that first snippet sounds like the popular theories how turning against thee queen are likely true light levels believe someone recently quoted luke smith saying that they wouldn repeat tdb mistakes how reasonably confident that vendor gear won exceed armor having said that wouldn shocked new vendor gear matches armor which also arguably bad because makes the first two raids skippable ,1
can someone please talk with via japanese and translate every bit info accurately possible ,0
 the light levels here are correct new vendor max then you can reach 156 light level with just vendor gear soooo once again they are rendering all raid gear obsolete instantly sweet use grinding characters ,1
 bites lower lip yeah that warlock crucible armor freaking sexy going have start playing lot more crucible get ready for another average pvp player ,1
may fucking love this game but new content until may what the fuck the playerbase will dissolve then ,-1
tits just booked off the 10th march for the supposed release ,0
 looks like people can buy their way once again rendering the current raid armor totally useless,-1
 they need wait until may work out bugs and drop the best product ,1
this kinda anoyys like destiny but running out things and may gunna stop play then kinda disappointed,-1
man that helm sick,-1
doubt they will wait till may 19th will lose daily players too long wait already have lost decent amount ,1
must lie armor looks unique for destiny supposed the same models but with different names ,1
its march pretty sure ,1
the way see seems that accessing this data that has already been pre loaded meaning altering his console system calendar trick destiny thinking may 19th this explained his sentence turned out was may that house wolves was unlocked the game result analyzing this implies that had through each date until may 19th enabled the first date for access ,-1
 guess time grind those marks til max then just wait for this release ,0
could you show the titan gear ,0
that hunter armor ,0
 hope its not may thats long time ,-1
 don know this game lasts the next dlc comes out may people are already max leveled and ready for new content unless they plan spending these months fix all the bugs the end game content make actually challenging instead bug cheese fest ,1
the helmets are just reskins and slight variants each other again ,-1
lol alllllll loooks likeeeeeee shit sigh dammit man feel robbed ,1

the gear looks really nice far ,1
but what are the materials required ,0
 knew wouldnt march wayyy too much gap fall and noone believed would late spring early summer well there you folks ,1
 due out may need some activities the interim keep people interested queen wrath better coming out the oven and better last for few weeks with new stuff each week ,1
may seems really far away this true ,1
this guys mega hacker lol all the items seemingly took game screenshots are listed the database not photoshop expert but the pics seem legit also mentioned that was able see the weekly activities for many weeks ahead wonder can shed some light what can expect each week ,1
just seeing this alone way more content with how the armor and weapons look tdb love the way those hunter and warlock armor looks with the titan being least favorite look pretty excited for all new weapons with way better stats than what have now also pretty curious about those white union weapons ,1
 understand that this all very early information very prerelease and very hopefully likely change but the vendor gear does indeed once again invalidate all raid efforts release day and previous raids won buying again after this expansion pass used way ,1
shit dlc releasing may was told march that loooong loooong wait ,-1

the new armors feel lot more space agey plus damn crucible hunter variants are blood spattered,1
when have the actual names these sure add them the spreadsheet though these might placeholder stats these stats are near identical the crucible and vanguard weapons seen pre dlc the crucible machine gun effectively carbon copy the zombie apocalypse with new skin wait and see ,1
any pics the new faction gear ,1
 think this good lets bungie really focus getting expansion right this ultimately their last shot because the initial combination bundle people bought this dives then comet will struggle all the content shows will just placeholder and will massively changed the patch similar tdb content ,1
 this true love you ,1
 know there will crucible maps maybe the info here just reflection the original plan placeholder ,1
damn may 19th thats long time true especially with the lack content received from tdb bungie better amazing job with this dlc otherwise destiny will put down the controller ,1

anyone want champ and put all these into full imgur album ,1
 going start peaking faction rep each characters now faction packages release day sounds like pretty great thing ,1
 sounds like this was some sort datamining and then glitching create screenshots moreover the hot fix destiny using the system the console will delivered about four weeks from now does this mean you are analyzing leaked and beta patches that are not scheduled drop for another weeks nice you share whatever this with the community but think your tentative conclusion overreach which you put with question mark know you not claiming certainty the developers may have may the drop dead date for dlc release and uncertain will ready march intermediate step they moved the pre loaded assets that were already partially added later date avoid issues like that accidental relaunch the not yet retooled iron banner the stuff you show not necessarily final yet either stats and wording could easily changed they continue play test the dlc content house ,1
luke smith last week will not repeat the error vendor armor invalidating previous raid armor release today look pic vendor armor light ,1

 basically proxified his connection and somehow forced the game connect the internal test server @ bungie guess this the only way have the updated events since everything managed server side now won get too exited @ everyone saying please push the content farther and don release until done etc imo done for very very long time since the game launched basically they just ironing things out and adding few requested feature such vault space but the content will 100 the same formula the previous dlc waiting for comet whatever the name which actually something they are actually developing but what sure that destiny just buffer fund the development destiny which will have wider scope and all sure major part the team now working destiny hence the lack weekly update and new contents ,-1

 maybe thinking this too logically and not super smart marketing but wouldn the release plan have made more sense month increments mean get the christmas push but tdb could have used month polishing and then come out right when the christmas destiny players had christmas gift cards spend and the dlc and raids various quirks could have had some ironing again sure dec made sense someone but all did was feed hour addiction and unhappy customer base who are going wait even longer for the big installment not mention months enough time for all the casual actually play and appreciate the game which judging the 800 hours and hate this game and quitting the demographic still supporting destiny,-1

more than the this could game changer eliminating petty corruption which adds gargantuan numbers take the mnrega good scheme long the money reaches the target and there asset creation happening parallely various studies have estimated that only the allocated money even reaches the intended audience the rest being swallowed along the way this worse when comes pds the state governments and their netas and babus also get into the act where only the allotted aid reaches the poor said plan panel study pds recently found that only paise out rupee was reaching the targeted poor montek singh ahluwalia cms the pmjdy can used eliminate the leakages that have plagued every single scheme indian governments since nehru have launched for every rupee allotted poverty alleviation only paisa reaches the poor rajiv gandhi this fixed and can will quite literally game changer ,-1

jan dhan yojna another scheme drawn congress just like aadhar sorry stop taking credit for others work,-1
 not that kejriwal does not realize that bringing millions within the fold organised banking one the first steps towards improving the lives the poor and people living rural areas just that simply can not afford give any credit the bjp politician and cunning one that all claims party with difference had been laid dust long back you look isn very different from rahul gandhi the latter was criticising the made india campaign the other day asking people they got any jobs since the scheme was launched ,-1
 not possible for political parties open their funding for scrutiny anarchist concept for political parties protest and raise public concern over issues government incentives and tax benefits given corporations are good for economy but subsidies are bad but kejriwal cynic ,1
hey aren you the same guy who told die change job farming because complained against modi and called bullshit his promises increasing msp that forgot those promises after wearing narendra modi written all over his suit according you your taxes are wasted farmers haha you and your theories you self righteous arrogant disillusioned urban dude ,-1
 now said that they will give insurance one lakh which person will get after dies this one the stupidest things has ever said ,0
 think you have really big eyes only see the one thing the guy might have rhetorically said the comment was made rally masses put forth point not for intellectual people debating cozy homes sipping masala chai you think your love for modi will make him good there are extremely poor india report jan 2015 its totally fair get 110 the sitting mps campaign delhi that extreme poverty can solved cold blooded capitalist and maybe good time will tell but the poor arent getting any shit from him the time wrote this message adani wealth wud have grown another billion increased 152 months modijis blessing ,1

 wise man once told never debt bank you end working all your life for bank not know what really but think theirs least some bright side this scheme ,1
 jan dhan means public money but where the money its more like jan account yojana that the meaning the quote kejriwal ridiculing the name the scheme but you miss the whole point being love love with propaganda further creating accounts not big deal even before jan accounts yojana every bank was made open zero balance account for anyone who walked through their doors that was the law ,1
 did you see the survey results today the more poor person the more likely she will support aap aap like what the commies and congis used are into povertarian politics and their detriment people move their life hence the attack schemes that have the potential this not cynical just lowlife cunning piece shit ,1
thats 10500 crores what was unaccounted wealth far just becoming white this huge how know that the black money not already coming back india through these accounts which good know also has flipside even fraction being illegitimately managed called middlemen can rob unsuspecting ppl their money hopefully banks become more stringent aware about only account holders handling all transactions such accounts but sadly dont see any special regulations place did miss something ,1
this the problem with kejriwal isn sincere about anything all not even corruption ,1
more than cynical call him douchebag acting like the teacher pet dekhiye maine apna homework class mein khatam kar liya baaki students homework bhi aap abhi check kar lijiye kind crap great that you take initiatives and the whole world would appreciate you for your going over and above the legal standard for funding transparency but stop trying become the standard ask for votes the basis your transparency don call other parties names because you have suddenly come with arbitrary new formula ,1

well this the cost not giving subsidies all the polls show the bjp aap vote split along the class lines the aap benefiting from offering freebies way step back for delhi back giving out doles they have the cheapest electricity the country and still want for free they are going bankrupt delhi ,1
 have fear that these polls will watershed moment next years indian politics aap wins back the freebie style politics didi nitish bsp will try party with and have fear will agree yes aap supports will downvote and question proof but this just feeling personal opinion fear you might say power hungry sorry you dont like yes namo but the means and end goals are different slowly will turn secular that fear why because has already morphed from anti corruption leftist socialist and already showing signs caste class based politics anything which will establish aap national party will acceptable heck gave delhi just that could ride the holier than thou wave for the lok sabha elections that was the gamble was willing play can any sane person that and please you feel that left because lokpal you are fooling yourself why else did aap suddenly contest 432 seats more than bjp unless they wanted ride that sentiment anyways digress bjp wins not saying that all will great but according the only thing which matters for india this time establish itself manufacturing hub else our next generations are doomed and call centers will not feed the next generation already the current job generation years are feeling the pain stagnant salaries modi wins delhi his chances winning bihar karnataka and that important for him ensure that that make india successful cause that will his 2019 campaign you can already imagine and feel how important this glorified municipal election unfortunately this becoming fight between highly myopic freebies such free wifi against the long term plans for the country ,1
 giving nice interview right now she genuine person imo win lose please continue the bjp need more people like you also the interview was nicely done talking about issues the ground etc why didn she talk like this before the elections also don agree with aap their economic policy but did support them until elections despise them lot although will interesting see their year government congratulations them ,1
voted nota today the delhi assembly polls that said the bjp losing battle which they totally could have won the first aspect the timing the polls second their lack groundwork campaigning the months leading now aap has been working its support the city since the lok sabha elections while bjp looked like didn give rat ass the third aspect that will cost them the choice candidate which they made seemingly desperate move essentially few months back and with harsh vardhan the candidate campaign leader bjp would have been okay say this even someone who never votes for the bjp ,-1

this huge two ways this can bjp and modi realise that the whole hindu wimminz need have kids rhetoric ain helping shuts down and doubles down what his govt actually doing well but not the news much thanks the lunatic tards they double down the rhetoric this clear verdict and despite what the bjp might say personally read verdict the rather the loonies around him and saying these loonies are better than the owaisi etc don cut they are not power and with the best mandate any govt has been given the last odd years bjp supporter modi bhakth and one that doesn particularly care for believe aap political entity though this good because knowing modi and shah they will most probably the first this will help the upcoming assembly polls also enough being permanently campaign mode modi you have nation govern disappear from the limelight your mann baath etc though for good months let shah run the other campaigns and let your good work speak for yourself the aap supporters hope throws away his confrontational ways and not hold ceremonies give sheep growers 500 while the niti ayog meet like certain momta did edit fuck the congress fucking thugs being relegated irrelevance bjp supporters got that going for ,1
 views why bjp lost bjp did kejriwal what congress did modi excessive negative campaigning turds like sakshi maharaj and niranjan jyoti forgetting they were voted power for development and not for hinduttava inability bjp control excessive negativity some pro hindu organisations like vhp against minorities lakh was chunavi jumla probably that lakh suit won too sure about though one remembers modi was for years before being generally thought that poor chai wala has become straight away and this poor man suddenly wearing hugely expensive designer cloths coming power giving issue platter your opponents course kiran bedi the seasoned leaders didn take lightly wont suprised they themselves have sabotaged this election the first time she opened her mouth becoming candidate made think that was going tough for bjp congrats aap supporters more happy congress rout than being sad bjp losing this should wake call for bjp they should control themselves before too late edit additional inputs ,1
the evms have been tampered maybe now modi bjp will start reigning the ghar wapasi valentine day kids brigade voted bjp for the development agenda and the hope that modi will keep the right wing fanatics bay modi honemoon period over yet apart from grand exercises abhiyaans and speeches there little change the ground yes development things take time but right wing agendas various groups did not take long damage the bjp only hope the delhi loss does not make bjp match kejri extreme left wing freebies policies ,1

its landmark achievement because indian politics has been dominated dynasty religious leaders glamour film stars and rich businessmen for the first time popular anti corruption movement led middle class technocrat arvind kejriwal has successfully morphed into successful political campaign the ruling party led vicious election campaign targeting kejriwal and his family personally calling him anarchist and closet communist his party called the common man party has routed both power houses indian politics the ruling hindu right wing conservative party the bjp and the gandhi family led congress party which has ruled india for better part its post colonial history means small achievement and confident that future generations will speak kejriwal less terms they talk about lincoln and jfk today ,1

 great day for the indian democracy because for the first time newly formed political party was able defeat the two major parties congress and bjp state provincial level the aam aadmi party the common man party left leaning party that considers anti corruption well swaraj reactive policy making from bottom opposed top down core values now obviously these guys are not the messiahs they suffer from the same shortcomings other parties accusations corruption divisive politics excessive socialism leaning etc however the win important because sets future precedent for new parties form and stand seriously for elections country where people generally get into politics only because they either have family connections participated the muscle man existing leader have risen the top slowly over the years that the time they actually get the top they are disconnected from modern values this system discourages average guy enter politics because they wouldn stand chance against the old guard yeah hoorray ,1
this win very significant the party has members from what known middle class and lower class educated youngsters daily wages earner and more representation common man entering politics they should have won and they did always told clean dirty politics one need enter this win paves way for that had they failed would have been difficult for grass root level person muster the courage fight least people now know this also way ,1

 pretty safe bet that modi will down the best india ever had ,1
good job coal auction now what the timeline where all those behind the upa scams are jailed and the money looted returned ,1
the problem with these insane auction revenue that the money eventually comes out our pockets basically the government taking huge loan with emis and forcing the people pay back both principal and interest some private company that they have control over the low cost the licenses helped boost mobile penetration across the country from million 2004 375 million 2008 670 million 2012 the lowered cost calls from increased competition allowed poorer sections get connected despite the rupee plunging from inr 2008 inr 2012 ever since the licenses were cancelled the cost voice calls has gone multiple times spectrum was auctioned the highest bidder years ago and were supposed have 150 million subscribers 2014 but all managed was measly million and coverage concentrated the cities and most rural areas don even have the option using even they are willing pay for but all the money from the bwa auctions ended being spent schemes like fsb aaadhar subsidising loss making psus like air india bsnl etc windfall auctions are never good for the consumers large because thanks the huge amounts invested upfront which are usually bank loans taken the companies they try recover much money possible the earliest and that means higher prices for everyone until they start making profits the same thing happened with auctions europe where telcos bid massive amounts the auctions and then failed roll out networks and went begging the govt change the license terms and allow the operators share networks etc meet coverage goals these coal auctions are worse because the central govt allocates the coal blocks and all the money goes the states which may may not have actual use for the money instead coming viable development schemes that get funding from japan etc now the states will able spend all this money any hare brained scheme that the party power can choose promote and unlike spectrum where both the businesses and the end consumers are located the same area coal consumers are not necessarily located the state that producing them people other parts the country end pumping money coffers the coal producing states governments and will not even see the benefits the 15lakh crores that going collected from them edit here opinion piece pointing out other flaws the system the auctions 115021601818 html edit2 not defending upa practice handing out spectrum coal mines their friends just pointing out the flaws going with the highest bidder shows shortsightedness the part the government short term good for the govts the day may lead long term pains and losses for the country large more other reply ,1
 you won hear word this from our lousy media kya ece there are links ,-1
online auction very good initiative and also like the fact tht modi govt wants leverage the use tech governance which will increase efficiency and transparency considerably should actually follow the best practises around the world and modify them suit our needs tht would truly revolutionise the governance our country agree tht there has been lot bad press for modi govt and count myself bitter critic modi and especially the party represents but lot this negative criticism could have been avoided the govt had not shunned the media and actually spoke out issues their silence ghar vapsi nuisance actually very worrying the rabid elements his govt cud take advantage this govt reluctance speak out modi actually staking his reputation not speaking out controversies raked less than his cabinet and party members ,1

weight the brand value than actual results most iit students are now working managerial level counter this the economy need opened allow more companies set this will give ripple effect getting more

nationalities help set corporate india true there are people who have challenged the system and made the nation proud but considering the potential the great nation the numbers who swim against the tide remains abysmally low its high time that the entire sector changed course can create and nurture potentials where stand now unfortunately the present higher education sector india like roulette wheel hard escape from its clutches but you are one the lucky ones you hit the jackpot favors less talent but creates populace that again studies and henceforth become teachers again the system the system solely existing make reason for the system exist the first place pure science streams have eroded itself that level where the sole existence subjects like zoology and applied chemistry and physics now create teachers rather than aspiring scientists the situation worse engineering streams where almost the graduates are unemployable any industry fortunately streams like english communication and and literature they have wide variety jobs that they are qualified for but its the sad truth that rarely their field learning policy documents and vision initiatives should used hardcore road map that can used predict and shape the future sector its highly important that eduction sector has clear view its role developing nation because ultimately each and every measurement

feedback current industry needs and what might require the future this gives chance for the university provide skill development which valued and appreciated the industry obsolete technology still being taught colleges across india likelihood its use apocalypse this thought process must uprooted once the basic skills have been thought industry standard technology must imparted and studied detail otherwise industry will have take pain retraining new employees which puts the company backward trajectory economic sense present syllabus being created and modified people who used work the industry this needs stopped the alumni the most powerful organization that the university can trust blindingly alumni must involved each and every process the working the university helps the long run keep gold standard thesis works numerous shady companies have cropped which does for fee final year projects and thesis works students flock these organizations they can receive the final product with money rather than true effort this has curbed original thesis work should appreciated and awarded relevant training technologies can mitigate lack confidence students and help inspire original thought processes students must benefit from technological prowess available and competent guides who can guide them rote learning should avoided and learning should imparted seminar style topics must thought drill the concepts initially and then promote self learning through self made experiments and research most universities multi disciplinary research and thesis works are not allowed noted that the boundaries study subjects are blurry line and most topics overlap each other students and graduate research fellows must given the flexibility research multidisciplinary topics rather than stay within well defined dark boundary engagement programs universities must have the potential leverage industrial experts take talks relevant topics least twice trice week that can conveniently held after class hours not disturb regular discussion instruction hours the benefit this method many students benefit from actual industry working knowledge and multiple topics can covered during the same bell curve grading grading must bell curve that shows students and learning associates where they stand relation the rest the class rather than blatant pass fail grade that provide information service provider questions must engaging ones that simulate the critical thinking faculties the ward dissuade students from rote learning methods like open book learning and sheets with formulas and data values must provided the advantage such system that students will forced learn the concepts and move beyond industry real life are workers forced recall mundane equations and data values even its emergency situation critical failure component factory equations not help there experience and wisdom helps that achieved and made logical thinking processes usage technological tools for better learning are lucky live age where all information can easily accessed anywhere the entire wealth human knowledge now available through the power the internet hard paper back textbooks must shunned away and replaced internet resources and line well off line discussion groups periodic test and assessment should done and evaluated using line tools that can exactly pinpoint parts sections that particular student must concentrate this also helps minute tracking the learning process and make sure individual attention can given for certain students certain topics language proficiency this the most important and relevant need students and faculty must highly proficient english language now the facto standard for communication across the world has needed given more preference than regular topics communication standards for students across india abysmal its best english language learning must given golden place among primary learning centers and undergraduate schools our researchers and graduates suffer lot due their lack proficiency which immediately closes lot doors significant effort need overhaul the higher education sector india the usage relevant tools and methodologies must taken haste hasten development the national skill set copying blindly the process nations that may may not relevant and suitable our conditions may more harm than good but imperative the change and development has happen time already past make the changes rapid overhauling with vision the only hope make india leader highly competitive world ",1

 much ado about nothing for the whole wall text you gave two examples the documentary ban and maratha reservation per the official press release the government absolutely clear that the makers the documentary violated some terms the agreement the government the right they want take action against them for breach contract second even the terms weren violated why should any indian even agree with the blatant stereotyping indian males rapist minded being sick society beyond yeah sepoys have issues have serious issues but how does the stereotyping and the sjw mentality crying muhh oppressors solve anything you think before this documentary came most were support rapists and suddenly seeing got enlightenment how does the issue rape india gets solved the documentary being aired britain nothing changed for the positive while plenty negative things have the potential happen tourism loss negative stereotyping our citizens living overseas etc are all very real concerns that should considered this whole documentary just reflection how rape has replaced poverty the descriptor india the parts the western world that still sees india colony great britain and not sovereign developing nation that doesn need the white man woman teach them civilization and solve their problems and not posting this bjp supporter even kejriwal mamata rahul gandhi had taken the same decision would have supported them 100 simply matter being against false negative portrayal society culture and country regarding the maratha reservations what did you expect them yeah they won this time but still they have win the next time bjp had not gone ahead with the decision the previous government give marathas reservations the same group that castigates them now for this decision would portray them brahminical anti obc party rather the bjp gets the actual ground support the people who voted for them than the approval people who wouldn even vote for them for some other reason not this stop treating everyone who speak against you your enemies any examples that rss has always claimed that not political entity please make sure you keep them their place the same with vhp and and what did they fud much anyone needs take the high road its actually the appointed fossils rajya sabha who have made clear that the country damned they are just going block every reform move the government passes that years hence they can crow this government did nothing plus its been just months citizens india the mandate was for years stop this fire the ass impatience and the utter cynicism the government they are doing excellent job till now ofcourse they have some issues that need corrected but every indicator points that this will down one the best governments india ever had till now edit esteemed member randia lol you disagree state words not downvotes ,1

 here copy the judgment 1427183283 pdf you can add this the post 123 page judgement reading now and will post there anything worth sharing first the final judgement 119\ conclusion may summarise what has been held above section 66a the information technology act 2000 struck down its entirety being violative article and not saved under article section 69a and the information technology procedure safeguards for blocking for access information public rules 2009 are constitutionally valid section valid subject section being read down mean that intermediary upon receiving actual knowledge from court order being notified the appropriate government its agency that unlawful acts relatable article are going committed then fails expeditiously remove disable access such material similarly the information technology intermediary guidelines” rules 2011 are valid subject rule sub rule being read down the same manner indicated the judgment section 118 the kerala police act struck down being violative article and not saved article summary reasons cited section 66a freedom speech and expression under our constitutional scheme stated earlier not open the state curtail freedom speech promote the general public interest reasonable restrictions quoting from another judgement the right freedom speech and expression includes the right disseminate information wide section the population possible the access which enables the right exercised also integral part the said right the wider range circulation information its greater impact cannot restrict the content the right nor can justify its denial public order all these counts clear that the section has proximate relationship public order whatsoever the example guest hotel annoying girls telling – this court has held that mere annoyance need not cause disturbance public order clear and present danger – tendency affect viewed either the standpoint the clear and present danger test the tendency create public disorder section 66a would not pass muster has element any tendency create public disorder which ought essential ingredient the offence which creates defamation section 66a does not concern itself with injury reputation something may grossly offensive and may annoy inconvenient somebody without all affecting his reputation clear therefore that the section not aimed defamatory statements all incitement offence section 66a has nothing with “incitement offence” section 66a severely curtails information that may sent the internet based whether grossly offensive annoying inconvenient etc and being unrelated any the eight subject matters under article must therefore fall foul article and not being saved under article declared unconstitutional decency morality what has been said with regard public order and incitement offence equally applies here section 66a cannot possibly said create offence which falls within the expression ‘decency’ ‘morality’ that what may grossly offensive annoying under the section need not obscene all – fact the word ‘obscene’ conspicuous its absence section 66a vagueness quite obviously prospective offender section 66a and the authorities who are enforce section 66a have absolutely manageable standard which book person for offence under section 66a chilling effect and overbreadth therefore hold that the section unconstitutional also the ground that takes within its sweep protected speech and speech that innocent nature and liable therefore used such way have chilling effect free speech and would therefore have struck down the ground overbreadth possibility act being abused not ground test its validity section 66a otherwise invalid cannot saved assurance from the learned additional solicitor general that will administered reasonable manner governments may come and governments may but section 66a goes forever assurance from the present government even carried out faithfully would not bind any successor government must therefore held that section 66a must judged its own merits without any reference how well may administered severability the present case where has been held above section 66a does not fall within any the subject matters contained article and the possibility its being applied for purposes outside those subject matters clear therefore hold that part section 66a severable and the provision whole must declared unconstitutional article challenge found invalid the petitioners were right this article argument would apply equally all other offences created the information technology act which are not the subject matter challenge these petitions find therefore that the challenge the ground article must fail procedural unreasonablenes having struck down section 66a substantive grounds need not decide the procedural unreasonableness aspect the section section 69a will noticed that section 69a unlike section 66a narrowly drawn provision with several safeguards first and foremost blocking can only resorted where the central government satisfied that necessary secondly such necessity relatable only some the subjects set out article thirdly reasons have recorded writing such blocking order that they may assailed writ petition under article 226 the constitution section being exemption provision closely related provisions which provide for offences including section 69a have seen how under section 69a blocking can take place only reasoned order after complying with several procedural safeguards including hearing the originator and intermediary have also seen how there are only two ways which blocking order can passed – one the designated officer after complying with the 2009 rules and the other the designated officer when has follow order passed competent court the knowledge spoken the said sub rule must only through the medium court order subject this the information technology intermediaries guidelines rules 2011 are valid ,-1

 modi you good feelings and stuff but you just don understand about quidditch ,1
there was genius redditor here who said all drugs hard soft should legalized maybe that would solve the problem free market brah,1
wow political conversation tagged under non political thread bikau mods,1
nothing can save punjab turned away from the gurus explicit ban alcohol and drugs sikhism now reap the whirlwind this modernity note the non punjabis the word means something very different right ,1
 lot the drugs come from across the border too the drug menace needs stop has become major issue punjab and nearby areas not just strict laws but proper treatment and rehabilitation for addicts remember that the psychiatric ward female addict got admitted our surprise the rest the patients knew her turned out she was drug dealer herself she turned this life after her husband got arrested dealing support herself she good into the business but slowly herself got addicted ,1
 new year eve bunch medical students from punjab had booked few rooms friends resort himachal they apparently were doing heavy stuff their room one them overdosed and died thankfully friend didn get involved the legal criminal issues real problem punjab yes driving night state highways mdr not recommended most people avoid unless convoy trucks one can get waylaid druggies looking get some cash for their next fix ,1
 the bathinda muktsar area fix generally referred majithia majithia dayeen two majithias please haa nava majithia aya hai yes have the new majithia but the horse tranquillizer users have their own slang generally headed towards pre bhindranwale situation can expect social leader emerge from this over the next two years but the problem with this land that movements take religious colour and fast degenerate into something far worse than what they set out fix and the fact that the police also heavily involved this racket the most worrying thing ,1
 want say something about this but what should this depressing ,-1
slightly digressing from the problem punjab the rat pack experiment tried understand why people get addicted the first place here comic based the same experiment ,-1
 actually works pgi and pgi would always see the worst affected anyways story time relation mine was incarcerated faridkot jail modern structure now everyone enjoys drugs inside that compound from the inmates the police yes the police punjab the biggest conduit the drug apart from the fact they enjoy themselves they sell that the inmates afeem opium not considered drug most punjabis and lot respectable adults consume but guess this how gets started before astray you put drug consumer jail will come out with hcv say that because know people who have they get with needle sharing and jail jail people tend fall into rut when incarcerated who are the sellers the village women local police can not search village woman way hell you can that village punjab without using army police always selected from amongst the local population they would not act strongly expect them without hearing from relations and putting their own family immediate danger the whole drug menace complex think the first step should legalization which will not happen scrap that they can start not putting users jail they would come out worse have get back work but could work actively this desires ,1

 sorry say but you are using the drug menace political propaganda for aap clear from your note drug problems are clear and present danger whole india juvenile sentiments and bruce wayne approach does not solve punjab has been hotbed for cross border drug trade its one our strongest regions and sadly easy target for drugs from across the borders congress bjp and akali dal not have political manifesto for drug dealing contact rss you like they hate drugs and would help you but you were here just start discussion for aap then you are just like one congress bjp and akali dal use problems for political mileage ,-1

part you have something mind please let know canadian born and raised punjabi sikh university student working through the sustainable agriculture program have few other western born punjabi sikh friends the program well most have decided that after graduation will punjab work with higher education institutes ngo and other grassroots organizations promote sustainable organic methods agriculture among farmers punjab firmly believe that reversing the damage the 20th century green revolution absolutely necessary pulling punjab out its current dire situation only returning indigenous sustainable methods farming can punjab future food security protected modern yet sustainable methods agriculture would increase yield protect soil fertility water levels and stop poisoning ground water addition the above points sustainable agriculture virtue being more human labor intensive would easily open whole new world job opportunities for these unemployed punjabi youths who turn drugs because they can find jobs sustainable agriculture would also wonders for women rights punjab this system just does not work without female participation and empowerment one the biggest issues punjab today that the husband father brother son dies killed the women the family are plunged into poverty simply starve death because they don have the means provide for the family themselves but because women are arguably even more important for the success sustainable agriculture than men and play huge role making work provides women widows and single family households the financial security necessary feed themselves pay the rent and educate the children even the unfortunate case where the primary male breadwinner gone for more that please see these short videos z4ws9emhve4 awfrpx slua top securing punjab future ecological security and food security protecting the water our homeland providing young punjabis the means escape unemployment and empowering women perhaps sustainable agriculture greatest benefit that unified community effort builds strong communities strong neighborhoods and strong families everybody comes together make success the historical success punjab has largely lied the ability communities stand together against whatever oppression they were facing humans are social creatures despite being the richest most privileged group the history humanity

agriculture not only makes 21st century nations food secure but builds community strength and brings people together jrz34dee7xy local sustainable urban food systems could have even greater effect the land five rivers but the most exciting thing about all this that isn just confined the realm theory hopeful thinking there are people punjab who are following the sustainable path punjab today and reaping huge rewards for one such person the the organic farmer anandpur darshan singh rudel french born british national who finally decided make home punjab and converted sikhi darshan singh totally believes the idea and spirit organic food does his better half but when they bought the land nurpur bedi family and friends actively discouraged them from the organic idea everyone agreed wouldn work out remembers wryly but believed and went ahead question principles says the farmer produce healthy food and consumption organic food leads well ourished body the farm which has undergone whirlwind change since darshan took work looks transported from another country altogether the landscaping effect beams darshan singh punjab farmers have change their farming concept that don’ want end with barren land our outlet here town have regular clientele and the number only increasing declares the rather reticent malwinder kaur who takes care the marketing aspect the farm but darshan singh rues governmental attitude the government does nothing for the few who are trying revive the fertility the soil fumes obviously there are people punjab already who are reviving the organic sustainable methods which have worked for thousands upon thousands years and they doing successfully think the best way convince people sustainable practices implement them successfully ourselves and people like darshan singh are living examples what possible when you put your heart and mind into the practice forget about two birds killing multiple birds all with one stone ultimately sustainable agriculture practices are something the punjabi people need start taking seriously again there seems very negative attitude our community towards agriculture like something only uneducated people would this needs change are ever save punjab from the dire situation think the reason that for the vast majority our parents grandparents did agriculture and they themselves are the ones who are pushing away from remember growing and hearing from father over and over again that the dream hurry and finish school get job accountant manager top bank the country sit air conditioned office clean environment and work for the hours and then home the wife and kids and that this what would make happy listened father and enrolled accounting university last year and dropped the class after month knew wasn for and despite what father may think not everyone wants sit around office doing paperwork all day now looking forward finishing sustainable agriculture degree and leaving work punjab with like minded people there someone out there reading this post who wants make difference punjab protect our ecology make punjab and hopefully set example for the rest india and the world food secure help end farmer suicide getting them out debt empower women widows and single family homes stop the use toxic chemicals which are poisoning our groundwater and causing rampant cancer among the punjabi population give unemployed youth life line get off the streets put down the drugs and bew able earn proper living for themselves and their families protect our diminishing water levels unite community living and strong families and transform punjab into one the most fertile regions the world then please note that never too late get involved this line work long you have the passion and plan intelligently you will succeed agriculture one field which will never stop being relevant there are people their late and the program university you want you can ,1

why gujrat where does gujrat stand terms contribution olympic sports for india there are many other states who have been exceling sports for many years now this the result the hardwork these states have put for sports and the atheletic culture that these states have been able nurture over the years but looks like there reward for good work someone needs break the news modi that now the the nation and not gujrat alone ,1

big time bad idea olympics have rarely contributed any kind positive effect the hosting nation ,1
bad idea they might even get since not many countries are interested hosting olympics has become very humiliating exercise last year norway pulled out cms 2022 winter olympics bidding because absurd demands from ioc officials the ioc hotel must rated either four five stars higher rating than any other client group the olympics the ioc hotel must offer full international hot breakfast buffet for two occupants for each room included the room rate catering services for ioc events and hour room service the hotel must have members lounge used exclusively ioc members there members lounge the hotel has install one their own cost doves must released after the parade athletes but before the head the olympic organizing committee speaks the opening ceremony signs around the city telling people where should san serif font and conceived part the look 100 security screening passengers and their baggage required prior entry into the ioc hotel this not requirement other hotels the venues must designed such that ioc members and guests are segregated from press and broadcast personnel every ioc member gets plus one the opening ceremony ioc members must greeted smiling positive and welcoming staff the airport starting two weeks before the olympics there are street vendors allowed ioc meeting rooms must air conditioned degrees celsius the ioc hotel must make available extra cost existing sport facilities such fitness facilities swimming pool and sauna facilities all ioc hotel guests and ioc staff members private cars must provided select ioc members the expense the olympic organizing committee volunteer drivers for ioc members must speak fluent english french and available work hours day for six days week plus ioa fucking dirty organization even ahmadabad gets should keep ioa barge pole distance avoid repeat cwg ,1
 seedha olympics and that too ahmedabad not cool modi not cool ,-1
don worry guys not happening many cities like rome hamburg and boston have showed serious interest hosting olympics 2024 edit also rome italy hasn hosted since 1960 they have high chance winning the bid hamburg and boston have never hosted and they also have higher chance than india plus this isn even serious yet dhondu just chiiillll ,1

white areas are regions frequent cloudiness dark areas are frequently cloud free few things about earth climate are immediately obvious lots cloudiness along the equator earth intertropical convergence zone itcz all the extra sunlight creates warm temperatures and general rising motion leading cloud formation the air rises significant drop cloudiness degrees latitude the called horse latitudes all the air that was rising the itcz gave its moisture clouds there and has back come down somewhere this causes general descending dry air the horse latitudes which why there are lots deserts those latitudes the southern jet stream doesn have much stop other than the speed bumps new zealand and tierra del fuego this tends isolate antarctica from the rest the climate making very cold and very dry which why antarctica the largest desert the world ,1

til not sure these are the only factors that affect the inflation and sometimes wonder inflation all that bad but one thing certain you make some interesting posts ,-1
 the weightage allocated cereals and pulses alone double that oil this the most interesting bit your post any comments the appropriateness weights attributed different commodities ,1
 add this not only was upa hoarding grains etc came the point that were very suspiciously importing onions import onions curb fresh spurt prices html there further pushing the country down the gutter ,1
hey rajarajac great fan your posts you have once again raised some very legitimate points here however feel that you are playing down the impact oil price inflation bit remember economics lessons correctly the argument goes that the price oil directly impacts the cost transportation goods and lesser extent the production electricity thereby having cascading effect the prices pretty much everything transport consume not sure about how big impact there due this relationship but this theory does seem reasonable for further reading asp this not discount the argument you have made food hoarding for that ,1

edit lol sanghi bridage downvoting with all their might posting this edit for the few people who expand the comment the frivolous and inaccurate not talking about the upa thing posted all that could spot and not know about the starting though completely wrong food prices are always correlated with oil prices and this happens for many reason transportation fertiliser production etc well know economic fact that not yet seen refuted the arguments the contrary seem you have numbers showing this don but neither does the have numbers stating the opposite that oil price decline did not contribute the fall inflation take the other stuff you will but honest opinion the statistics bullshit oil prices are and always have been huge factor food inflation economics 101 comment the upa hoarding though while may have been big factor oil prices were definitely more than just minor factor according most estimates oil and other fuels accounts for cost food production trying imply that oil prices are only fraction food inflation bullshit fact this food beverages and tobacco rural urban combined fuel and light rural urban combined basic maths dictates that item has weightage the key driver inflation while something with overall relatively insignificant important but not the driver complete crap that weightage contains oil prices built into the statistical term you looking for serial correlation where the supposedly independent term are actually correlated with each other ,1
 posting again here since you keep bringing this childishly dense claim wrong net inflation affected the price oil and hence food inflation well the numbers aren going disappear just because you keep your eyes shut tight source inflation,-1
 add the above there were multiple other steps that controlled inflation 360 degree approach aid the bird brain memory the masses and media off the top head soon was elected may 26th itself bjp brought potatoes and onions under the essential commodities act the face sever protest from vested interests brings onions potatoes under essential commodities act html govt brings onions potatoes under essential commodities act the decision will prevent hoarding will place upper limit holding stock wholesale traders and others the decision taken the cabinet committee economic affairs ccea will impose limits the quantity onions and potatoes that individuals and wholesale traders can stockpile the move will also empower state governments take measures prevent hoarding “despite adequate availability there has been increase prices onions and potatoes there have been also complaints hoarding ” law and telecom minister ravi shankar prasad said “ want assure all citizens that our government committed reduce prices ” said within the first month assuming power bjp set 500 crore price stabilization fund control inflation the production end perishable commodities starting with onions and potatoes growers themselves can avail the funds that doesn impinge the markets but aids the farmers ece the psf will used advance interest free loans state governments and central agencies support their working capital and other expenses procurement and distribution interventions for such commodities the ministry said statement these commodities will procured directly from farmers farmers’ organisations right the farm gate mandi levels and made available reasonable prices consumers ,1

 read this brilliant article pratap bhanu mehta great deal agreement though few things have changed since modi became and large the article holds good even after almost years few points from the article for all the hoopla over reforms the development models all political parties look pretty much the same the particular differences are due the timing and context when they were power both are incremental reformers both reform largely when impelled crisis and the variations their stances are variations circumstance not conviction both believe the rhetoric the poor first both have roughly the same approach institutions they are instruments used those power not instruments protect against them there actually more fierce contestation and blocking decisions precisely because there much underlying agreement when there deep consensus the ground the conflict longer disagreement ,1
not bjp supporter the problem have with people justifying this changing for the better that bjp going stick congress policies what the point voting them every criticism bjp govt gets you responses either congress was worse you anti national the opposition currently congress easy pick any point they raise why didn you this yourself bullshit the two parties keep flinging shit each other for the same actions the same issues while common voters get taken for ride honest was happy under congress rule there was much less vitriol the govt communication there were govt cheerleaders the ruling party didn make their supporters feel like victims secularism think said this before and say again rather live with scams than communal hatred ,1
bjp different from other political parties india when comes shoutfests and posturing the media when they are opposition and compromising when they come power also believe that any political party should pragmatic their approach and stands have changed according situation turn today would have been the wrong turn years ago another point noted that modi was not the helm bjp when many these statements were made his personal stand might have been different and since power has the ability change these sees fit still there are many disappointing turnarounds that said here take since promised the major hangup according the article before was regarding the guarantee supply and tracking nuclear fuel indo french deal ece has pretty much guaranteed lifetime supply for french reactors what this would mean that other nations would have follow suit will lose out against the french henderson brooks major fuck they should make public but believe there are few major bomb shells there that making the govt hesitant the same hold trues for subhas chandra bose fiasco well aggressive posturing for vote bank but the basic theme has not changed calling sharif for inauguration was good move gave diplomatic leverage pakistan issue something have live with only thing government can increase covert ops strengthen intelligence and speed arms procurement something parrikar has been doing quite right after years fuckups afspa still effect its draconian law and should used the right proportions the after article mentions that bjp will govern such way that afspa will longer needed turn here they never advocated for permanent afspa see the major issue raised bjp during that timeframe opposition was that they did not take the opposition into confidence secondly the illegal immigration from bangladesh has reached its heights bjp wants cut down that and dealing with exclaves the first step that process retarded oppose opposition definite turn that would support uma bharti talked about years you look the years plan talks about short term changes years medium term next years and long term next years there are things happening the ground level example phase clean ganga campaign completed 201 html definite turn and something don like aadhar and uid has been badly managed but the other option let the 1000s crore spent the project pragmatic approach would have been audit check the discrepancies the system modi was against not giving fitting reply ceasefire this time around the response was not something mild 1272821 aspx has bjp said anything about not giving delhi full statehood whats the turn here bjp supported the old bill and wanted changes that 2015 they are proposing new bill with changes that they see fit will reply the rest later you fill them ,1
whoa quite list there you have but despite these turns still with them for these five years the bjp govt isn doing any good for the country they thrown out without shame the next general elections let see what happens ,1

why still use party names actually union govt india fighting with delhi government this itself shameful nice that delhi govt resisting getting bullied despite being debutant ,1
dear public memory very short delhi forgot sheila dixit and her contribution delhi metro then kejriwal kis khet muli hain secondly how long will kejru harp upon alleged injustice kitni baar chutiya banyega you should remember his antics follow the law diminishing returns the more randi rona does the lesser the output will get ,1
 when game going full retard you can only with you start going against you start going half retard you´ fucking done for n0tail 2014,-1
everyone knows delhi not full state cause they know that police not under chief minister kejriwal already has said that 100 times last 100 days nothing new happening this will earn kejriwal nothing but fight get statehood for delhi what happens delhi does not affect bjp any other state all one punjab cares that delhi can appoint his own bureaucrats kejriwal now involved the leader statehood movement thats far away from his corruption appeal and also makes him local state leader thereby reducing his appeal other states bjp has already written off delhi cause congress was power there for years and now aap there for minimum and maximum years delhi out reach bjp anyway ,1
yes delhi turning out the achilles heel for bjp think they see but giving into would bigger morale damage across the country think about this way that they agree his demands easily their image will get bashed across the country better for the matter reach the courts and then the courts will rule aks favor and bjp will oblige think they view much more honorable defeat and you say the man the streets doesn care all knows wants something bjp not allowing courts allowed now will bjp losing brownie points but only delhi and frank enough they not care about delhi anymore and why would any political party care make easier for the winner when they were defeated unceremoniously ,1
 forget the legalities for second think the people the man the street doesnt know what the law states this same for subsidies the common man doesn understand why subsidized gas and electricity are bad does that mean shouldn remove subsidy culture for once think bjp right they have 5years let them what they think right for the country they could have easily encouraged subsidy and other popular bad decisions and save their seats for life but they have chosen not ,-1
 the man the street you need give him good roads electricity control local food prices the local man doesn give one single fart about anything else daresay that the overwhelming majority the electorate this country didn even vote out the upa because scams and shit but more because they failed provide roads and control food prices now don live delhi don know what the mood like but reasonably certain not very different from what described above ,1

 agree with you there another aspect kejriwal loves drama all this protests make him even more popular bjp inadvertently making him even more powerful which good dear bjp keep ,1
this jung thing disaster for bjp should have left kejri alone could have failed his own anyway bjp just created more aap fans they are acting scared aap ,1
 isn bjp should stick the constitution and call kejriwal bluff high time the called clueless average voter learns bit civics lessons otherwise easy get convinced parties like aap congress rjd etc which work the low information voters bjp should stick informing the voters what happening and ask kejriwal take walk does pondicherry even chandigarh one would give rats ass ,1
modi sat his office staring out the window the sprawling gardens 7rcr everytime looked out reminded him how hard had worked get here from selling tea the railway platform the most powerful man the country the journey had been interesting one always believed that wouldn have been here were not for some divine intervention his faith lord rama was unwavering till yesterday but some things had changed overnight which made him question his own beliefs the first time became was sheer luck was the right place the right time keshubhai patel health was deteriorating and they needed replacement modi had worked towards gaining favor with the right people within the rss much that could give them ultimatum that either gets the top post the state doesn get anything all somewhat reluctantly the leadership anointed him the gujarat after that there was stopping him won one election after the other despite being blamed for not doing enough prevent the 2002 riots won the election that followed almost immediately modi knew the pulse his voters and knew that his core constituents will not give two hoots about the riots was right won twice more 2007 and 2012 then finally 2014 got shot the top post and his electoral victory streak continued even there modi turned around and looked the indian express spread his table the full page headline and picture announced the victory arvind kejriwal aap the delhi assembly elections shah had called him give him the news their impending defeat day before counting began his sources already declared that aap was going win although they couldn pinpoint how many seats they will get the headline blared modi had not felt such burning anger long time his winning streak was broken man who protested the streets puny activist was one the same breed people who hounded him for years about the 2002 human rights violations all his political life had fought these called civil society members getting rid them any way could and now one those activists had defeated his party the most humiliating way possible modi received text his phone was from shah hausla rakhiye abhi toh jung shuru hui hai ,1

 will leave cents about this whole issue here opinion bjp fears aap will become national phenomenon the whole mess started when delhi election got waaay more national attention than should have was almost like modi kejriwal bjp was flying high moral was high congress was humiliated and bjp thought was this historic moment where can cement its government for long time but aap got way too much national attention hell people were almost excited the national election for the delhi election and the win pretty much shocked the entire country lot people did see they won with that margin they must doing something right modi wave over aap tsunami sweeps delhi was all over the media bjps momentum was brought grinding halt sure that same day bjp decided make work for aap hard possible this not new the when obama became president republicans pretty much openly declared they are going block every action the president and not let him work also this success seemed have gone aap head and they fucked several cases modi biggest fear aap delhi may become the new gujarat which won modi 2014 election aap did very well going national phenomenon aap has backing the urban middle class they get into other sections they can real danger but this new lows from the bjp let aap function the way they want they fuck let people vote them the fuck out like congress also please dont give aap anymore excuses they can come with bjp does not let this not our fault just let them they screw atleast they cant blame the bjp wish more people get this dont owe anything the bjp aap congress should have zero loyalty any political party just vote for someone who you think will the job they dont vote someone else need stop being emotional about political parties they play with our emotions our loyalty only this country bjp not 100 right aap not 100 right congress not 100 right citizens aim get combination government opposition out these get the best governance aap and bjp make each other insecure and make them work harder good for rant,1

 unnecessary controversy which could have avoided many people including our media will only derive one meaning from which women support terrorism however the other meaning which immediately comes mind that tough for women against things like religion terrorism bangladesh given how taslima nasreen was treated must difficult for women express their opinion freely about things like religion terrorism lets not think about terrorism here from indian perspective remember that what call terrorism what many hardliners well commoners pakistan bangladesh call struggle for freedom ,-1

 good thing that such tends cannot down voted certain group like can india don think went through your posts and all your posts are filled with blind hate for modi there are many supporters for modi twitter and reddit including yours truly you say something bad about him true not his supporters will not like there are many people who support him not just group that why your hateful posts get downvoted you should try doing some constructive criticism you can for this did indeed say this would like see the context though then should criticised hope apologises clarifies but you cannot take bad thing and ignore all the other good things has done improving our relations with bangladesh and then call all idiots funny how you complain about brigading and twitter trends the same breath anything reddit prevents brigading despite what you may believe twitter brigading rampant not saying the trend which fully justified you stated result brigading but brigading common twitter ,-1
there were few blunders the whole speech let our own dreams shatter that bangladesh could prosper something that effect pakistan naak main dum kiya hua hai while watching the whole speech imagined worried mha officials working furiously preparing clarifications the was speaking rather like modi unprepared and extempore way speaking however often unable speak coherently and talks speaking his living room where goof ups are allowed because likes talk informally needs very careful when speaking such high level ,1

 agree the should not have wear his patriotism sleeve same for all muslims the country there are some bad apples but there are many others that don side with the stupid fanatics similarly modi doesnt have come out every single time and admonish idiots who are radical hindu rss side for even though wish did because considering the questions his past and his standing the leader has coming out and saying this not right but imo simplying tad bit let call spade spade there lot shit that goes the muslim side muslim law board and lack ucc come dude that effed either are secular state are not shout out for goa the only state the union india with uniform civil code there doubt bias india against muslims unfortunate but exists and that manifests itself many ways how people interact with muslims etc sometimes feels like vicious cycle speaking folks the courts and the prisons not problem that limited muslims alone somewhat factor the messed judicial system draw parallel with caucasians and african americans the there inherent bias based what have read against african americans and there might something similar indian setups definitely worth looking into but would look for some data making sweeping statements makes you somewhat guilty even discounting your rant tone speaking like the idiots you rightly ridiculing ,-1
unfortunately this exactly what you will get with the bjp this party that largely came prominence after its leaders participated the demolition the babri masjid and have continuously spewed rhetoric against minority religions india modi used blindly spew the same rhetoric this the same person who referred post godhra refugee camps for muslims baby making factories used the term hum paanch hamaare pachees refer muslims both generalisations that have basis fact however modi realised that project himself prime minister cannot project his hatred result shakha indoctrination directly therefore the run the elections completely avoided the topic religion and personally focused development however other party members threatened send people who didn vote for modi pakistan spread fud about love jihad divided people into haramzaadas and ramzaadas and other such general nonsense the fact that these luminaries were rewarded with ministerial birth being made charge elections state tells you all that you need know about bjp remains bigoted party borne out bigoted and sick movement hindutva whose only aim ensure that india regresses socially into hindu theocratic state where other religions live second class citizens are shipped off other countries unfortunately due lack better options had make deal with devil gave simple majority bunch old farts with extremely regressive social views let hope that enough social fabric left the time these guys are done with our country ,-1
you should have included this disclaimer from your own comment history just clarify muslim having allergy for modi brigade comes naturally once the dictator loses elections and minority pleasing congress comes back power you will gain faith the idea india again not you just might settled the foreign country you are now why would you care about india then anyway whichever way look don see why should actually look deep into your post ,1
good point our govt hinduistic nature hence they use that weapon politicize and secure vote banks just like congress uses minorities will not have major effect common man calm down ignore media based propaganda and live happy life ,1
you need relax man these things will blow away now lets try have reasonable discussion you start your post saying your faith the idea india going down the idea india this idea that insults the traditions the hindu majority this idea which has subverted the the minds the people this nation such extent that the mere act taking pride country past called communal introducing sanskrit studies called saffronisation this idea which doesn work towards national integration but divides the country into many distinct identities possible using religious caste class faultlines this idea that celebrates socialism and keeps people poor poor for fucking years resulting the lowest low indians who are used slaves the gulf and other lands this idea which insults hindus and their age old traditions philosophy and their scientific acheivements this idea which course celebrates secularism yes this celebrated word upom which reams and bytes words have been written which course has nothing with equality religions and lets face can islam and christianity really call themselves equal other religions that would blasphemous only the deluded and foolish hindus who keep parrotting all religions are equal sorry say but this idea time has come consigned dustbin new idea being created which will celebrate our hindu buddhist past the countries south and south east asia once looked upon india their mother civilisation the chinese upon death wish the souls their departed west india that they can peace with buddha the japanese used call tenjiku the people heaven this idea that will celebrated india profund gifts the spiritual world will celebrated 2014 and modi election was merely the final nails the old idea india but the hindus had already started becoming more assertive earlier internet brings all kinds information and india develops more people will discover india past and rightfully proud being part the world oldest and only continous civilisation the romans greeks mayans persians have all been consigned perdition the chinese have profound hindu buddhist influence the chaiwallah puts india towards path growth the country should the world 3rd largest economy decade the other points you raise are mostly political but here too much the blame can put the muslims much bjp when hindus are ethincally cleansed from their homelands muslim came out protest raise voice against them when yoga day was being endorsed 160 countries was the seculars and some muslims our own country opposing just final point pakistan and bangaladesh are muslim nations carved out india specifically that muslims can have their own lands india secular constitution but hindu buddhist its ethos and culture its the hindu majority that provide stabilising influence their core philosophy live and let live deny them the right celebrate preserve and propagate their culture will met with increased resistance going forward these are intial stages the motormouths bjp rss may come across bit too hot things will cool down and say look forward ache din the buddha has started smiling india now ,1

boss vajpayee was there went away when looked like was going stay for decade modi may too may not these are all temporary hiccups meanwhile you have noisy religionists who make very easy for these guys stuff like this basically creating the right environment for the spread hindutva minority extremism creating the fertile ground for hindu extremism which would have been lot less potent otherwise ,1
you only have your leaders blame and the kind people you have voted into power the past even the the country constantly under attack the pseudo secular gangs and presstitutes for being anti muslim which probably not just look the media political circus over yoga pathetic sorry but have sympathy for you deal with ,-1
because celebrating anything hindu opposed muslims and christians alone when did sikhs jains tibetan buddhists have problem with hindus the persecuted tibetan call india home and have never faced any discrimination hell they have settlement karnataka all the places but when did you hear that tibetan buddhists and hindus were rioting always muslims and hindu who riot and then this squarely blamed hindus the reality islam needs substantial reform and muslims should step and work towards rather than being stuck with this 7th century mindset ,0
okay but you realize that the well was poisoned islamists who have always put religion ahead nation country ,1
idea india lol,1
personally think that this whole muslim apologist thing has been created the media and has gone far enough you should look certain businesses that only muslims run and hindu never into them like leather meat bakery etc then why don you say muslims are victimized and frankly the western media that doesn want hindu muslim peace indians don really care except very few which are there all religions whether someone hindu muslim this wedge created the british unfortunately has lasted till today and due backward thinking people will last longer high time that people realize that most indians hindus aren discriminating based religion ,1

 but such things remind you that you just muslim more than that and all the suspicion justified well look from non muslim perspective all the famous terrorist attacks were committed muslims you cant blame people for being suspicious just because muslim don have feelings for country countrymen muslims obviously suffer problem might sound crass but you will have tackle this problem marketing problem ,1

wasn the scam exposed bjp government itself was going since decades cbi intervention required believe many people from bjp congress are involved this since long time blaming modi will not work should instead use social media demand cbi inquiry ,1
scams his party his party chouhan government helped unveil the scam creating committee that did the investigation the scam scam that has been going for the past years they the wrong let fight this but least show something substantial other than the inability handle such large case which should dealt criticising and working with the government help resolve its incompetence rather than throwing baseless accusations which think would more accurately described hopeful dreams conspiracy theories because accusations least have facts this entire accusation was started digvijaya singh trying get political points against chouhans bjp government used evidence provided him whistleblower against chouhan which turned out forged but that was settled but the outrage wasn apparently again never attribute malice that which adequately explained stupidity last remember using the same aphorism many times was truthers ,-1

 friend mine once told india such backward shithole look the usa they have plans make high speed maglev train between and and what cant even produce good train our own conveniently forgot that the usa was highly highly highly highly highly highly highly x1000 cannot stress this enough industrialised nation 1947 that had the resources entire continent with perhaps the best scientific and educational base the world support 1947 were among the poorest people the world with hardly enough food feed ourselves and nada zilch zero industrial base talk about educational institutions and scientific laboratory all and look now yes have long way but have come mighty long way ,1
this yes india bad but was way worse even decade ago some things stand out consumer choices remember the days when you had ask relatives from buy you stuff not anymore women empowerment you now see women doing jobs once done mostly men seen women taxi drivers petrol pump attendants etc woman working now the norm not the exception entrepreneurship now being celebrated instead looked down upon alternative careers apart from engineering medical are encouraged fresh law graduates now make iit level money remember when the kiss scenes murder caused moral panic now porn star acts our movies and dont give shit metros coming most cities improving infrastructure everywhere long way but are getting there,1
 agree with all your points but for child born 2015 just does not matter how india was 1947 what matters the probability getting good education and health care that can grow become competitive adult unfortunately lot children born this year will still malnourished illiterate and disease afflicted this unacceptable even comparing with 1947 the absolute number children who suffer more because population has increased fold while wise could better the reason why people complain because progress not line with our potential our human and other resources remain untapped and wasted not skillfully channeled into solving the problems still lose obscene talent brain drain mainly because government apathy that why complain not because not progressed from 1947 but because could done much better and more importantly the problems why did poorly still remain unfixed corruption culture and still slows progress compared potential realise that our children will face same problems and that frustrating fair both sides need list areas where pathetically failed our universities are terrible public policy making not based research government primary education system same for decades government hospitals and public health care shambles still have malaria typhoid diarrhea while abolished many countries progress painfully inequal across states and are helplessly electing idiots power many our friends have chosen emigrate out those countries that are 100 200 years old and have made getting card those countries their career goals and succeeding whoever chose stay back are being shown that our decision stay put was bad ,1
yeah too much negativity the problem with our exposure the western world have adopted casual disdain for our achievements are just years old compared western nations who are more than 100 years old also forget two important things when compare ourselves with china aren homogenous nation like china extent still live democracy the biggest democracy compared their all encompassing communist state ,1

completely agree you are one favorite redditors for reason great job recounting what many seem forget all the time now all this being said prefer people complaining loudly and not whining about whatever state are not enough for from per capita years want get years now not enough that all are agreeing with this while sitting our offices and with choice whether read this post computer phone phablet want the people dying heat rains cold also feel that their india much better not enough that the rapes the indian army kashmir have come down dramatically want the careers army men with even circumstantial level evidence being destroyed even they get away from convictions not enough for that get india what could get the want the places orissa and jharkhand get what delhi had 1990s not enough that have had only 429 deaths 2015 10x 2000 response for just deaths reminds them the outrage for 176 deaths mumbai personally think that criticism and lack satisfaction which can directly attributed the great indian dissatisfied customer keeps pushing forward indian really want the karmanye vadhikaraste phaleshu kadachana give way did work bitch where tree fiddy least for the next decades want india nation where not just the owners but the workers live happily too sure have come across long way but there still much more and just hope that whining turns into complaining wish that people get into more arguments within their families board rooms offices friends and make bones about the ugliness that still present aplenty our country investor and have made conscious choice being this country since know that the animal progress out its cage and will very rewarding here the next years not try even engage the argument that you are making for the pure selfish reason that the more the india story oversold the more have ability buy anyone who questions the india story out touch nris extreme leftists who cannot digest progress global investors are all just foolish according don try correct them just plan benefiting from the complaints that are coming loud and clear everything from rape corruption secularism poverty terrorism you name since these complaints are fixing the system love when indians like mom just pick the phone and complaint the airtel guys that the net not working all and check and see mbps and decade back she did not even have reliable 512 kbps love that the taxi wala that spoke with yesterday had gone and seen bajrangi bhaijaan with his family and was complaining that the ticket was 120 bucks head and the movie could have been better love that was asking for advice buying house kalyan better schools cheaper rent open spaces but just wish that does not stop complaining any time soon had choice between satisfied people and complaining people world view india needs both right now and may complaining people just bit more ,1

 agree but like point one more thing that had not been for inherent corruption all level called functionary departments would least years ahead what are now lakhs crores till now has been funneled into the pockets corrupts instead being spent development nation imagine every paisa least majority ever put aside for national development was spent the purpose was truly intended for how developed now network roads electricity and water lines not only small towns but majority villages all across india enough storage for our food grains lakhs tons which rotten rains every year better education education system now place not adequate any sense and doesn invoke creative and rational thinking its just rote learning exams put more emphasis learning stuff and solving question rather than understanding concept and applying real world problems degree has more value than skill upto level ofcourse and much more not countering you but feel ourselves are responsible for the condition had have now and the one who were are supposed guide the uneducated ones and show them way toward progress were are the one who chose choose misguide them and even use them for their selfish insatiable desires but not right compare two nations with developed one with developing one each one has its own history and plethora issues hidden behind their nice shiny cities and hopeful that with right steps right time still have much potential march ahead thnks for the patience while reading this ,1

same thoughts especially after reading couple books india after gandhi and india unbound should also take pride institutions like iit iim that are well regarded and established isro another great scientific achievement along with our nuclear program wish your post had more concrete points though another great point that decade ago think most would stand line buy train tickets you were well off tell travel agent now almost everybody books tickets through irctc and stumbled upon the train booking office yesterday and there was barely any queue extension this post should also list out concrete improvements like see various aspects india years from now for example our per capita income should increase that govt procedures still riddled with corruption like lease signing etc digital possible that our government schools now register 100 attendance and churn out excellent students who become successful doctors engineers ,1

 another child the while admire your perspective and trust your facts your narrative not convincing forward movement itself given for any society when you consider years there period indian history where there hasn been forward movement over that timeframe even including the worst company rule what drives emotion the rate forward movement india share world gdp was not the lowest 1947 but 1990 just before pvn liberalization kicked when compare the rates right before and after obvious that years were wasted there also doubting that the current productivity the indian population continues stifled albeit with looser noose you assume indian identity after 1947 monolithic but think bimodal distribution closer reality the incidents goonda raj and wanton crime you mention may have occurred the hinterlands somewhere but the metros were nothing like growing sub metro part the educated middle class experienced none what you describe city bangalore was wonderful the police could trusted hell even the auto drivers were nice ask feel happy because bihar has fewer booth capturing incidents bit rich you sound like those people who ask happy because india didn turn out like the congo when know the country had everything become europe you paint overly dark picture the 1947 the 500 princely states line much bandied but little more than theatre the british provinces and the largest princely states mysore hyderabad baroda and held 250 million the 300 million inhabitants india aside from these only others even had state government the administration the country was quite robust and had been for hundred years then the prophets doom who said india would disintegrate were more credible than their descendants today who claim that india going fall apart any day now because maoists operate full india 625 districts any field from business tatas birlas cipla you know this one science the arts india was bunny 1947 there absolutely wonder that produced swaminathans krishnaswami ramaiahs and ramachandrans the wonder that there were few the examples power cuts bigger highways faster kiosks pay electricity bills like presenting figures peanut production growth and asking feel proud don recall ever thinking that powercut long queue pay the power bill was major concern and doubt you did either ,1

weird think your friend the grip cult out curiosity who this jain guru does not consume any allopathic medicines western medicine medicine that proven safe and effective will just refer medicine henceforth allopathy this unfortunately not uncommon opinion held india mostly because low levels education and low levels availability medical services but thankfully its dying out doesnt have much with jainism you will find people all religious faiths spouting this nonsense india indian produce better not grown with many chemicals and this actually somewhat true because the west most food has been selectively bred with the purpose extended shelf life food also transported over large distances which means doesnt ripen the tree which makes the flavors not good they could but blanket statement wrong and things are changing india too what can ask his guru ships disappearing over the horizon question good because you can actually see the curvature the earth the spherical shadow the earth causing lunar eclipse another question germ theory another question but doubt anything you ask would make any difference cult leaders are very clever sociopaths who construct alternate reality lure vulnerable people their trap they are fully cogniscent that they are committing crime and may even assault you continue their empire ,1

this just being overly dramatic the ramblings the uae foreign minister few months ago about the yemen participation pakistan was just done pressure pakistan into completely aligning with the gulf uae does not and will not make political statements that aren backed the rest the khaleeji countries suggest that uae pursuing more india focused diplomacy political future not true true from purely business perspective which happens the only thing uae rulers care about terms india pakistan relations the whole gwadar port business has pissed off these city states and they are pressuring pakistan abandon since will hurt them economically the use such politics just mask the real issue they have with the port the vague and contradictory stands pakistan and turkey are absolute proof that arab security — from libya yemen — the responsibility none but arab countries that statement cute the gulf arab countries have always relied pakistan for their security and have been the biggest contributor besides usa their protection have been training their previously non existent armies and are still doing that india will always try undermine pakistani interests but there reason believe the gulf will turns towards india other than for business they simply cannot that even they wanted ,1

 would really like see buddhism getting hold outside the nawayana ambhedikarite movements not criticizing those any way however shifting the emphasis social and political issues they often forgo religious ones even introduce things that are not directly related buddhism like new conversion procedures that are focused actively rejecting hinduism and gods and customs besides the usual taking refuge the three when religions get strongly involved politics always affecting their basic philosophical and spiritual aspects whatever going with ambed wold nice have strong religious presence not related that that not say need buddhist domination like once was the case but like see getting the point developing home grown indian buddhist tradition where one would able became buddhist scholar monk teacher entirely within the indian culture with all the needed institutions teachers logistics and literature being local instead just spreading various existing traditions tbetan lankan whatever would like see that the west too btw not sure though that even they stay clear politics they would not picked some nationalist hotheads ,1
how has one mentioned deuter nada himalaya particular good album ,1

 think the more advance society becomes the more open they become for buddhism first step buddhism understand that life suffering poor countries don have money and they think they will happy once they become rich but developed countries you already have the money but you are still empty inside and this where buddhism comes into place ,1
hinduism has become such warped practice india most people practice they would western religion such christianity seen these boards buddhist legalism also quite useless and not much better than western religion most people who follow buddhism the west believe mistranslations and misunderstandings ancient wisdom must reborn and cultivated ,1

whether namo orchestrated these attacks not will always for debate will eve give the benefit the doubt the courts and accept that innocent the worst thing come out from this for that lot people that know actually believe that namo was responsible for these attacks and that was the main reason they voted for him ,-1

can someone post this post please ,0

the fact your job involves stopping the next hardik patel from using inflammatory whatsapp messages mobilize masses illiterates what options you have remember our police force also semi literate have already seen what happened bangalore with mass exodus north east people thanks rumors social media 2012 how the government expected handle such events without proper controls you start out with the assumption that are surveillance state then where the heck did this hardik patel emerge from days its obviously incompetent surveillance state that case ,-1

 veggie madhya pradesh bans eggs anganwadis felicitated turns out some non bjp states too don provide eggs midday meals malnutrition atrociously high eggs were supposed cheap source protein counter this problem they were scrapped simply appease small minority cms bjp ruled bmc has banned sale meat for four days during the jain festival paryushan turns out happens every year since 1994 after resolution congress govt 1994 the ban duration was increased days 2011 again congress ncp govt bjp increased eight days cow slaughter banned states most them non bjp maharashtra introduced beef ban meat all bovines banned now nobody had problem with cow slaughter who shifting goalposts here ministry home affairs cancels fcra licences 975 associations but 2012 total 4138 ngos had their fcra license cancelled because similar violations how can you not see the fact that more than double the number ngos got banned the irony that bjp itself controlled ngo called rss ,1
 the ban duration was increased days 2011 again congress ncp govt can you give cite for this ,0
aha whataboutism 101,0
this the kind that giving modi bad name rightly wrongly people will blame him for ,-1
 you arguing that current bjp govts are worse than previous congress govts hardly high standard ,-1
the problem with liberals sjws and intellectuals india that their mental capacity never expands criticize the government issues like inflation job creation policy reforms etc but rather petty stuff like kitne ande hai khaana and somwaar murgh kyun nahi milega ,-1
 tldr that don expect anything better from bjp they are bad congress ,-1
 bjp just bad the congress some cases worse that what you are trying say because that what looks like ,-1
quite the eye opener this why harbour such disgust for liberal hypocrisy they create fake narrative hindutva fascism when such things happen under bjp governments but can even bothered when routine elsewhere thus somehow everyday life becomes emergency when modi even nothing has actually changed since the days madam sonia and her secular friends ,-1
logic india 101 ayy you stole omelette well also stole your omelette yesterday you didn say anything then toh that doesn give you the license steal omelette kya baat hui yaane you have problem with and not with losing your omelette wait wtf dekh bhai that omelette was the worst thing have happened forget about that fuckin omelette now have this dosa made home purely vegetarian and think would good for you but but want eat omellette nah omellette bad for you and next time shows tell him fuck off cool ,-1
and yet dont get militarize control southern asia ,0
with rss vhp goons which bjp employs whose major job create riots and divide people can faulted are extrapolating certain events heart don want hindu pakistan and obviously this how started there too all aware the hindutva plank bjp has reached 282 2015 from 1985 kindly cut the bullshit want the govt focus developlment and are nowhere wrong faulting them feel how you explain the hold rss govt never elected rss how you explain attempts writing history saffronise murder rationalists diluting cases against hindu extremists hounding teesta bjp actions delhi via one has quite blind and illogical not see the bend and your assertion that modi literally hitler and bjp the majority appeasing fascist party one actually said that extreme best suited for fanatics which bjp filled with its ranks and files ,1
 meat costs more india government subsidy should focus providing healthy balanced and hygienically prepared meal the lowest possible price simple ignorance and unwillingness research which most the media always notorious for this actually issue thought was widely known that the bjp didn have role introducing this years wonder why modi didn simply repeal prohibition the problem here adding more states that list don know the story here opinion statement don know the story here opinion statement,1
whatabout whatabout whatabout whatabout whatabout were you born 2013 there was outrage when congress did stuff like this infact the popularity congress all time low precisely because they did bad stuff criticizing bjp endorsing congress congress has been fucking failure and people voted bjp with such massive majority because they thought bjp would different when bjp does the exact same thing the congress did people outrage and rightly ,-1

though both the national parties congress and bjp are somewhat similar bjp has nutcases and dumb ignoramuses more than congress bjp has good share intolerant chauvinistic religious bigots imported directly from the cow belt which den ignorance and parochialism like leaders from bjp some are really good like piyush goyal suresh prabhu and rudy but there are also lot embarrassing ppl the party whose ideology communal and who prey politics hate and polarisation tht probably the main reason dislike bjp congress sinking ship and mostly wiped out many states dont think there alternative for bjp the national level other than weak coalitions parties with regional influence ,1

thanks for posting one the most descriptive pieces seen india however have issue with the fact that your headline and the content don match hindus may feeling prosecuted and marginalised but your article about the insidious harm casteism and baptism the opinion that the caste system would have been lot less prevalent today without the reservations economic reservation doing that our state essentials tells one more deserving simply birth this current sense victimhood combination factors the religious appeasement policies and the caste based appeasement policies ,1
you are right your observations but off the mark some group obc and forward caste members sensed that this would break the unity the hindu community and immediately diverted the issue ram temple which reminded them their common faith highly doubt that ram temple issue was created rift divide only conincidence that the just revived bjp from the ashes bjs needed issue survive they promptly picked ram temple issue because they wanted fight congress which was pro muslim kerala fortunes from hindu temples are nationalized for benefit all communities while those from churches mosques are tax exempt dear you are spot this one athiest but still feel one group society definetely victimised because this the marriage market where the truth about our divisions are magnified again spot the inclination assert one own social group the best can come from any human being earth excuses gdoms was the invasion tipu sultan which not now you are inside kerala history dont know thing there ,1

you realise that you will get very little resonance here randia particularly anti hindu one just has observe the daily circle jerk against hindus rss shakhas bhakts etc know this true the sheer amount abuse trotted out hindu gods and goddesses would counted hate speech any other forum but randia business usual and the mods look the other way when people abuse hindu gods let someone abuse islam christianity muslims christians then instant ban well written article though excellent insight and perfect ending imo ,1
 things identity politics your bane minority appeasement wrong minority protection and actually ensuring that everyone gets have fair chance correct unfortunately actually implementing even accepting what entails ones best interest many things which seem first glance stupid turn out correct laws and conversely many things which seem reasonable turn out have many unforseen and negative concequences when dealing with affirmative action laws read only headlines and you fail the nation ,1
 think you are overthinking this bro there are some institutional advantages minorities have which are grossly unfair reservations and ability use hundi money but these few issues are changed and they can there isn really any other problem personally think religion losing relevance slowly our country ,-1
 realised that the marriage market where the truth about our divisions are magnified that when our archaic tribal instincts come out even pretend modern the outside superficially well said bro ,1
good guy proud you man ,1
nice post however don think unfair minority appeasement has led directly the rise hindu fundamentalism but rather general hindu antagonism which tends lend itself well hindu fundamentalists for example there was post about how atrocious some aspects the rte act were about year ago remember like you mention actually discourages majority communities from running educational institutions and that for testimony sorts the genuine problem minority appeasement india does exist and ignore narrow minded stuff like that can really make the majority feel inferior and disadvantaged and that obviously will lead disenchantment and even discord that think where hindu antagonism ends hindu fundamentalism begins think when that opposition deliberate disadvantage twisted into generalized opposition the recipients the unfair advantage separate community whether nor they are adamant retaining that unfair advantage hindu fundamentalism and hindu extremists are reactionary they have played that reactionary role for long time mobilizing mass opposition specific thing into mass opposition the recipients that thing even when its usually disconnected and vote hungry political class that created that thing and its subsequent strife the first place like you said sometimes you may not deserve advantage accorded you over poor brahmin boy and sure many many many people share that opinion across all minority religions the problem always starts and ends with gross generalizations matter which side you just two cents ,1
 but does the mistake painting all abrahamic minorities one brush don they all believe that there this one supreme god who will give you salvation you believe him and act his holy book and otherwise will damn you hell isn this the reason for conflict between abrahamic religions among themselves and with other religions and also the reason for conversions ,-1

looking the comments its looks like you are staunch hater modi dude there are more logical and reasonable ways criticise him whether his tears were real fake only can answer and not bound answer every stupid question now tell what gained after that far questions are concerned organization would want fuck such grand event stupid questions asked strangers only questions were asked which were handpicked the whole event was just formality honour his visit was not like presidential debate that happens usa chill out man now will downvoted like crazy ,-1
 highly likely that these two got ask the questions because they were internet org partners and thus got advantage but does this establish that modi knew the questions beforehand and mark question that led him crying was known him well fun make theories but think that they portray india someone who cries foreign land for cheap publicity going little too far ,1
this some weird circle jerk organised and planted questions that could used argument for internet org and most probably answers were already prepared like done every event every leader everywhere the world his crying was genuine gains publicity crying when media was already harping about his trip really stupid circle jerk took few days photoshop the pictures think ,-1

 not modi speech anymore modi concert sap center the question how long can this fake persona survive empty drumming ,-1
 totally agree that this was incident but the fact that mark was looking into the teleprompter because modi was speaking hindi language mark would not understand the teleprompter could just showing him the translation when first heard about internet org was very negative about totally kills net neutrality and boy the biggest supporter neutrality but this thought occurred that what the audience net neutrality the poor country side indians the biggest concern that buying internet pack not one time investment you have keep buying every month for someone who doesn know what internet and how can used this could used demo for free and anyone who wants leverage complete internet can always buy data pack any deal has both the parties benefitting see this the companies facebook reliance and other sites part this build good reputation and deep penetrate the market for the non technical country side indian they get see the premise internet don think bad earlier thought ,1
really you think that faked crying what the hell gain from watch that video its not like was crying out loud infact was trying hard contain his emotions and not the first time got emotional while talking abut his mom ,-1

 but very limited the focal length the phone camera phone cameras are almost all wide angle the iphone focal length about 29mm which less flattering than 85mm and above think would produce acceptable web quality photos but not print quality ,-1
because clever politician knows that commenting this trap open pandoras box both the left and the right will spin and interpret what ever says the tone and the content will heatedly discussed all over the nation not statesman like vajyapayee who can make statement and bear the brunt withsand the consequences ,1

this actually part familiar pattern swami adityanath sadhvi niranjan jyoti and giriraj singh have made outrageous remarks and modi stayed very silent modi simply cannot afford upset hindutva elements starts leaning leftwards they will find another bigot even you develop yoy 2019 bjp cannot win without polarisation religious lines and fragmented opposition the reason worried that these incidents have ripple effects theoughout the country yesterday there was rumor that somebody was killed muslims hyderabad thankfully turned out rumor things could lot worse god knows give rats ass about but letting hindutva forces run riot causes all kinds problems for everyone everywhere ,-1
this girl looks familiar feel like she from something edit someone explain why being downvoted ,1
 met guy who shot with very expensive gear nikon and leica the pictures looked craz sharp and has good colors but that was they had soul and were boring look yet all his friends were complimenting him telling took gold pictures was very awkward just nod felt was rich guy with too much time then met another amateur photograph shooting with simple nikon d750 knew was only amateur wasn raving the same friends compliments but was still getting lot praise imo was much better photograph yet had lesser gear use great video shows you don need carry 4kg dslr take good pictures ,1
playing devil advocate has commented elsewhere when the victim and oppressor demographics were reversed curious know this since would reveal any hypocrisy ,-1
this guy looks familiar dont think its him but looks exactly like someone from old reality show cant put finger real world road rules had guess maybe survivor ,1

 photographer consider using cellphone for tricky spots and situations only the phone can raw photos apple does this for iphone going one happy photographer ,1
they should played this vid the launch event best sales pitch ever,1
from you comments here quite clear that you are not asking question but want people bash modi for not condemning the incident wrong and you are indeed asking question here what think about this live third world shithole called india man lynched for allegedly eating beef another burnt alive for entering temple yet another raped the age years and then there couple publicly hung from tree for marrying per their wishes these ghastly incidents are almost everyday occurrences here expect the prime minister condemn each and every incident you want him condemn the dadri incident because the victim was muslim and the issue was the much publicised beef ban dailt might want him condemn the hamirpur incident women might want him condemn the pilibhit incident who all does please and what will all this achieve have federal government with layers governance going down the level panchayats there are district officials and party spokespersons communicate the official views the prime minister has the overall responsibility the country and honestly speaking naive expect him get involved all this condemnation business and frankly even was tweet about this people who have anti modi agenda and who have been waiting for doomsday arrive will not view him his government any differently isn ironical that people are blaming the rather than blaming the under whose direct control law and order the state vests redditors would make you believe that everyone uttar pradesh and all across india was happily consuming beef and celebrating eid and diwali together till modi came power imposed the ban aroused communal feelings and caused one innocent man lose his life someone who lived his formative years western uttar pradesh let tell you that the animosity between hindus and muslims spans decades and has nothing with the bjp the rss you want glimpse this please read the pucl report the meerut riots which resulted the infamous hashmipura and maliyana massacre modi did not tweet criticizing the muslims who gunned down jain boy meerut the muslims who thrashed two jat boys death for resisting molestation their sister muzzafarnagar reverse the communities and would outraging about these incidents well ,1
same reason why nobody from opposite spectrum comments kashmiri pandit issue now down vote just like you did when commented that scam too kashmiri muslims begging name kashmiri pandits without knowing such things happen did hurt your secualr feelings why were you down voting ,-1
this dadri case reminds peepli live yes the issue was different movie but media and politicians reaction has been along the same line have look kind news which emerging kejriwal first tweeted about authorities stopping him from meeting victim family then tweeted that has been allowed enter posted images with victim family ndtv reported their media crew car was stoned crew attacked dadri car window smashed 1225670 while the cops stood spectators rahul gandhi visits dadri after kejriwal and look the crowd surrounding him png bjp managed open its mouth but that obviously didn down well free the suspects isolated incident like they aren even trying few others went there well but cbf look them now now compare with peepli live village had never heard after spending almost years and around that region now trending twitter politicians always are milking the best their abilities visiting the family waves doing photo shoots with the family and showing sympathy with their fleet vehicles cops have been deployed huge numbers maintain law and order media camping out there for any shred story they can capture fabricate guessing there might even small town fair sorts with locals trying make quick buck out his sudden surge visitors like they did movie and here are wondering why hasn yet another politician showed his fake sympathies 140 characters less when the story dies natural death terms trp these camera carrying vultures will start disperse that family will pick pieces whatever left was gifted them from the politicians leave town which they should imo and wait for the eternal justice granted our blazing fast and competent judiciary ,1
 honest even atal bihari vajpayee had the courage openly condemn godhra incident against his own party and the rss goons and without any pre scripted media conferences this however himself one the rss people obvious how always becomes tongue tied whenever hindutva goons murder someone and commit crimes ,1
out habit,0
dadri lynching was not some unplanned random incident these are carefully planned bjp part their election agenda there communal tension all over jharkhand just before the bihar elections muzaffarnagar was planned fore the 2014 elections etc asking modi condemn these incidents would mean going against his party policy ,-1
maybe him its small incident statistics people dying from population billion isn worth even cough ,1
the camera isn important you can quite lot with d7100 and fast glass buy the camera you can afford and save the rest your money for better lenses right you don need but budding photographers would better off ditching their kit lenses keeping their bodies and investing fast glass ,1

thats one unusualy good looking neighbour,1
 iphones have been taking amazing pictures since apple went with the bigger sensor the techniques used this photo shoot are basic knowledge photographers ,1
 mean understand that the iphone can take really great pictures especially for smartphone but better than d750 with the huge full frame sensor with interchangeable lens hell the ability change your aperture absolutely huge photography but the iphone can that understand the whole photographer not the camera spiel but you just simply cannot expect iphone produce similar qualities photos ,1
 yea right and hugh hefner neighbor ,1
what more surprising what the congress doing they are the called opposition they should attacking modi government right left and centre like the congress only playing covert game publicising all communal tension news that that itself would try and bring down the current govt without getting involved mud slinging what more startling than the strategic silence the govt the silence the principle opposition ,1
way get views but she hot,1
had until with little bit photoshop ,-1
 better tapping that mella ,1
still requires worth apple gear ,1

 far too busy travelling lands far wide delivering speeches fawning nris fail understand why such great orator tongue tied when comes issues like this like manmohan silence was tactic for the rampant corruption namo just encouraging the rising intolerance,1
sources say modiji was very upset and that chided all the bjp guys who provoked the thing and also those bjp guys who came out support later ,1
 sure didn hear about and thought everything under control like you know that time when assured everything was under control while the gulberg society massacre was boiling and would for hours after his assurance this guy busy with hard work and getting investments that just doesn seem notice law and order problems going right under his nose influenced the lower rungs his own party what man ,1

 speaks indirectly through his minions listen what mahesh sharma said this was just accident people are trying give communal overtones his mla from the area said that hindus are being targeted some such only condemns deaths when they give him political mileage for example when that person died kejriwal rally this death means nothing him once called politics footpath politics also cms,0
this actually pretty informative video the girl the bikini doesn hurt though ,1
 101 doesn matter you are modi obama bill gates sachin tendulkar when you have large audience listening you then talking about safe subjects has more impact than talking about controversial subjects there always someone else available who will make the controversial points and take the brickbats ,1
 posted somewhere else too modi served pracharak propagandist purpose post was spread sangh ideologies throughout akhand bharat all know what sangh ideologies are you can estimate his devotion these ideologies with the fact that one point time decided become pracharak which requires one man leave his home not get married single why are you expecting that this man thoughts are any different from those religious nuts anything should thankful him that not opening his mouth these issues further worsen situation ,1
 this girl isn model wow,1
 was very telling form his first days office when disbanded the usual gaggle journalists who fly air india one with the and ask questions was further reiterated when stopped taking any questions all only pre scripted pre screened ones this has been going everywhere goes all his rallies and his rock star shows for the diaspora everything screen and pre screened carefully wonder what would happen the person the audience who doesn ask the pre screened question but instead asks real hard hitting question you know the ones like all heads state have answer their nations media and people only speaks things can control and ignores much reality the fact that was propogandist for rss for long speaks volumes that ideology ingrained him and very much leader all these hindutva rss extreme right wing people his minions the bjp echo his words but doesn need speak them otherwise will implicated very smart and very dangerous man not the kind india deserves took pride our diplomacy and our soft power pms who were the highest caliber least the international scene modi classless buffon embarrasing wherever goes ,1
because modi sincere politician and doesn want lie firstly honestly doesn give fuck about one dead muslim village has perused the facts the accident his union minister put and would know that mob killed the muslim hindu mob which was assembled the pundit temple meaning the killing had the popular support the village and you read the statements coming from the hindu right they haven outrightly condemned the incident either that why the local branch bjp has lent its support the killers and more importantly last time some muslims were killed mob narendra modi won the election for three consecutive times there absolutely political incentive for namo condemn the incident secondly there india beyond msm english press and reddit and that india many hindus support the action the mob and those hindus will cast their vote the upcoming elections amit shah knows that namo knows that ,1
because behind all the sophistication has crass shallow personality remember the crore girlfriend remark can you imagine nehru atal saying things like that rss pracharaks after decades indoctrination become the sort psycho which modi the difference modi highly functional one true for religious nuts among muslims christians too man just wait the day modi realizes may lose next elections will stoop his original riot mongering avatar maybe next godhra gujarat riot isn far away and would very sophisticated ,1

mandir and beef ban supporter here what your ideal view india ans ram rajya you expect muslim free islam free what you expect muslims ans convert they did before but you dont need worry all this still years away however modi fails can happen quicker seculars don realize that modi the last hope ,1
 eat beef not really support beef ban however believe the protection hindu religious sites not necessarily mandirs ayodha kashi and quite few others are sacred places for hindus most these are not well maintained and there needs concerted government effort improve them far the ram janmabhoomi movement not sure that the birthplace ram but from the asi findings remember congress was power then clear that there was temple there efforts have been made reach out the muslim community provide them larger land area bigger mosque alternate site believe the best course will for hindu religious sites declared exclusive areas just like mecca vatican and resolve this issue ,1
 islam does not belong india backward aggressive way and holding the country back has away need with force and violence muslims are india because pakistan shit hole simple that they could turn into islamic republic they would without thinking twice don trust them and don want them here dream vision would india which similar what our indoeuropean nordic and mediterranean brothers built switzerland sweden italy etc have the same roots must capable the same even greater what muslims you are muslim and want stay here just stop being one stop wearing your attire cap and ugly partial beard stop slaughtering animals stop holding namaaz arabic and you can this little steps doesn have all once you don have nationalist etc just stop being part the muslim community don vote against the hindus you are hardliner devout muslim and want stay have bad news for you not ready compromise with you and not ready give without fight and that means pure violence the solution then good luck you and your brothers ,-1

end game that reminds something hitler might have said would phrase that differently because there end game ,-1
supporter economic policy and governance part bjp selectively sympathetic their hindutva cause but frequently find myself disagreeing with their agenda this front against beef ban any restrictions society because their interpretation hinduism let people decide for themselves they should stop preaching morality and clothes also uncomfortable with most them being just political hindus and being atheist agnostic and indifferent their personal lives that being hypocrites that also dangerous frequently meddling hindu religion without believing god will not make such people compassionate they will just look things from cultural angle whereas the culture itself has become regressive lot ways okay you don believe god hinduism but that case not speak for hindus and hindu religion not talking about those who just beleive hindu kulcha and soch you aren hindu the context talking about know advani wasn great believer and know many the current bjp guys aren anyways are digressing ram mandir front think should just follow whatever the supreme court rules sure there was temple there which was demolished and then mosque was built upon that sure there are hundreds such places india but have move and some time stop seeking justice for atrocities committed past the same time beleive bjp efforts educating people about history and rewriting parts which have been intentionally twisted for agendas when people say there was temple there why the fuck you want one more temple deny that such things happened past strongly disagree but when they say fuck and let move agree minorities status and issue the end game have mind pretty simple equality for all that simple but still very controversial christians want proselytising they want bastar and tribal gujarat and convert people there christianity alright fine with but then let hindus and rss the same calling ghar wapasi xyz just semantics the hindus are using money for that fine christians that too but not fine they are using threat violence for now some liberals use the argument that christians shall allowed convert but not hindus hinduism never believed that bullshit and sinister the other thing want end game respect for each other the name liberty let not start drawing prophet cartoons and start pissing idols you are atheist okay fine but fucking keep yourself don make fun preach you are muslim keep yourself and will friends also favor ucc favor some compromises from all sides some hindus and many jains are strongly vegetarians respect that and accommodate them not having butcher shops beef festivals very close them muslims believe only one god and explicitly say there isn any other god that alright that what their religion but not bloody come and tell that god fake don office railway station have seen some christians that and any public setting keep yourself muslims should not forced prove that they are indians but they should also not give impression that they put another concept over country stupid things like not saying vandemataram talking about caliphate opposing yoga supporting the enemy country should avoided there are lot things hindus also need but this post isn about that limiting myself topic hand ,1
the problem your question the wrong place beef ban and mandir issues are supported hindus age and above uneducated villagers who most probably dont use reddit hindus below and above only want modern and progressive also clean india most them think modi can make this happen they voted him for development not for religious bull they not expect muslim free india just want them progressive and less religious that opinion from what have seen among friends hope other users agree with answer ,1
send them pakistan india must free all abrahamic filth and outside influences only then can have unadulterated kulcha also only then will hindu kulcha supremacy recognized destroy sickularism also send bar dancer obviously sinse she foreign origin she must some kind whore sonia màino they always try call her maino attempt deligitimize her via her origin birth home italy get badla for all those years muslim rule btw this some really mild stuff bal thackeray has said much worse muslims are spreading like cancer and should operated like cancer and they gave that fker state funeral smh the way ive actually seen parts sarcastic comment expressed serious comments india comments with positive upvotes may add ,1
 expect this country islam free not muslim free the future and this tinderbox only needs trigger explode leaderless muslim world anyway being bombed into the 7th century major world powers like france israel and russia there another type terror attack then life will become living hell for people with muslim name some them will fight back with jihad and others will convert change their names that time find employment decent home very similar what happening europe where syrian muslims are converting christianity boost their chances getting employment and citizenship ,1
didn comment this thread first after seeing post titled end game for muslim creating false narrative demography destiny ,-1
 guessing most bjp supporters think that the vision indian israel would ideal complete with next door neighbor following the enemy religion who they can bomb whenever they feel like not gonna happen but ideal situation ,1
too bad most will afraid answer this question wanted read some real replies neither hindu nor muslim ,-1
 atheist here but still think can answer your question see lot people with hindutva principles even family feels like hindus are victims christianity they don like the conversions especially and islam they act like muslims are terror groups and for the muslims and the christians also feel the same way that they are victimized sickening see india being pakistanized the hindu right wing ,-1
you are simpleton and have been victim superficial propaganda you think bjp and its supporters including have such retarded things beef mandir etc our agenda its all media hype with only the whackos taking these petty issues seriously its the low hanging fruit for the lowest common denominator sane person the bjp camp even talks about these things hard bjp supporter including their religious agenda and let tell you brief how think greentext tiem india highly fragmented feudal and poor only ideologies make this diverse bunch behave like country slavery the name gandhi hindutva search your feelings and history and you know true ridiculous that foreign woman from different race religion country continent born and raised under different set cultural values for decades can come here under the banner gandhi and almost accepted our prime minister and was definitely accepted the head the most powerful political party india for over decade country diverse india predicted west balkanize somehow went through its bankruptcy and came out single nation state reason hindutva hinduism slavery name gandhi strong the abomination from the foreign whore literally cannot talk straight for than minutes literally makes sense all congress wants him the next prime minister their friends media intellectual circles and corporations end supporting him because they despise hindutva for real imagined reasons clearly congress has done and will more damage the country than hindutva can even imagine have good leaders hindutva modi and shah modi has actually proven himself gujarat done good work spread out over decade these can separate the rhetoric from reality advani was too much mandir movement modi uses hindutva gather support but does per wants good pragmatic politician now the rest how muslims must behave something according anyone who supports congress the enemy our nation state doesn matter how you give your allahus your akbars how you shove your jesus your christ how believing chubby kid with talking elephant head gives you meaning life you support congress then you are traitor book and you must eliminated any means necessary you support any other party then willing tolerate right now destruction neutralization the congress support infrastructure across political social and economic circles should our top priority now assuming the congress support infrastructure destroyed then and only then and not before rss becomes problem must eliminate them replaced better trained and equipped police force under independent judiciary but with covert powers hindu intellectuals become problem must eliminate them anyone who tries add religious talk education gets ass fucked hindu muslim christian cow piss magic bullshit earth 6000 years old and being pedo under special situations totally bro talk can and about this but won for the purposes this thread these points are enough and about ram mandir the rightfully hindu territory and will have back time the hate muslims have for american christian troops for polluting their sacred land mecca official motivation bin laden apparently the same hate hindus have against muslims for polluting our sacred land ayodhya only its worse our case because christians churches are not actually present inside mecca but muslims mosques are actually present the site ayodhya its also worse because christians came saudi arabia with the consent the government king whatever but muslims are staying ayodhya when have clearly stated that don want them there don give fuck where muslims choose live and build mosques india but atleast leave our sacred temples alone you motherfuckers don understand how this even for debate babri mosque culturally pretty insignificant muslims some mosque made name king but ayodhya and ram mandir are culturally extremely important for hindus the city 7th avatar vishnu who the preserver part the supreme being holy shit just give that small piece land and let worship our heroes and their flying monkey sidekicks why won muslims give possible that muslims think even the destruction single mosque for good infidel cause anywhere the world means that the holy war islam against infidels just took step back and that cannot allowed happen just imagine how much peace would there muslims let build our temple like holy shit can achieve many different goals simultaneously creates good impression hindu community discourages communal politics throughout india makes leaders like advani irrelevant rss and bjp loses good part its support you can emotionally blackmail hindus the future for reservations something this genius political and cultural move and yet muslims won this makes seriously question the loyalties muslims community seriously think they will demand another pakistan their numbers are high enough well just hope muslims begin rape and pillage europe soon that might see how the west reacts godhra style riot happens the west then they lose the moral right tell brownskins how deal with muslims and that gives our hindu right government that much free hand whatever the fuck wants ,1

the numbers may not lying actually india slightly more peaceful but not owe our leaders what actually brought upon the change narendra modi biggest grouse was that felt that media was unusually harsh him for 2002 murderous hindu mobs guided congress politicians roamed the streets delhi slaughtering sikhs and most the main accused never faced justice same goes for bombay riots shiv sena goons rioted with impunity and the chief accused managed scot free same goes for bhagalpur and many other instances communal riots what actually changed from 2002 the ubiquitous television camera ground reporting media yes the same msm which few never tire complaining about forces nay shames administration into taking steps quell disturbances the state has always possessed the capability control these communal disturbances but due its own biases and the bigotry those administration the mobs were allowed violent but the omni present media makes tougher now yogi adityanath demonstrates riots are still looked upon some quench their lust for power but now when yogi makes inflammatory comment recorded the act and though seems insignificant small way made accountable for his words and deeds would have gotten away with lot worse earlier should also explain why some people continue complaining about media say what you will but the glare televisions cameras make the engineering genocide bit tougher however any riot shameful because these riots operate with the complicity those power and each act communal disturbance indictment the political leaders ,1
whenever see statistics trying prove disprove something immediately grow suspicious numbers can played around represent whatever you intend show impossible conclusively infer from them now coming the numbers and chart that article please take look the source mentioned there htm tried playing around with the numbers just the author has done and realised number flaws first visually the chart wrong take look kerala has coefficient 2014 but the orange line does not dip below that region all the author forcefully trying prove trend secondly the methodology incidence communal violence given state given year from which subtracted its share the total population the country wrong you have states uts which have had incidences having different negative coefficients relative their population thirdly any statisticians out there back how does the number incidents correlate the population the state which means delhi meghalaya which have similar population will have the same baseline subtraction theoretically are taking for granted that the rate incidences similar populated states should same why this comes next point that indeed the data has shown like this then another variable the percentage muslim population the state also has taken into account guessing the author only intended focus hindu muslim conflicts and not hindu christian hindu buddhists now this will also show interesting fact the states uts with highest muslim population percentages lakshwadeep assam kerala actually fare quite well this study anyways after about one hour playing with the data was confused what objective was when started off because these data not really show any significant trend anything think the author mentions this the article well you can manipulate this data whatever extent you want and can show exact opposite trends what would question why are looking bad now worse than before have muslims been faring better the past and half year their more confidence between the communities now has inter communal relations become more hostile over this period these questions cannot answered these statistics ,-1

this article doesn make much sense think its fair question the influence that power the center has the rest the country but think most people are generally concerned about how the general rise power hindutva outfits and the sangh parivar affects hindu extremism this framework its not about which governments are power its more about how general rise power affecting local dynamics congress run state for example can see rise communal violence local hindu extremists are becoming increasingly bold and violent but does make any sense blame this congress unless you trying actually disaggregate the data and explain different trends communal violence different states this kind use statistics just useless hence the saying there are lies damn lies and statistics also the author article plainly does not have good understanding math the first place for example there have been some dubious attempts make such assertion looking truncated and incomplete data thus was asserted that communal violence increased nearly the first five months 2015 under the modi government against the first five months 2014 during the last days the upa the actual raw numbers are 287 incidents january may 2015 against 232 incidents the corresponding period 2014 leaving aside the fact there’ relatively small absolute difference between the two numbers and there’ way know the difference statistically significant the larger point that comparing any two arbitrary time periods one can get just about any result you want the conclusion here correct but 287 incidents compared 232 incidents not relatively small absolute difference that increase you can just proclaim this statistically insignificant because its inconvenient please folks actually look the article and engage with the numbers instead just accepting the title fact ,1

generally speaking the main quest affected side quests and job quests with people acknowledging who you are job quests can potentially have you affected acknowledging you are adept different job job quests and side quests generally don recognize you for the main though these are usually time bubble the main quest events don affect these quests meeting estinien the main quest won have him act like you have met him when you the dragoon quests ,1
 loved that the npc from last year all saints wake recognized the cutscene this year ,1
this also happens with quest text the character was imported from some main scenario npcs the story will say they feel like they know you from somewhere and after the final fight everyone starts remember you cid even mentions how you saved the world twice like the adaptive quest texts makes feel like more involved with the npcs lives ,1
 congress plus cow has way with his words ,-1
another reference remember one hildibrand quest you did the quest where you end giving godberg massage acknowledges calling you the first time appears the one with the strong yet tender hands something like that ,1
yes there few places where lines are little different you unlocked certain jobs off the top head know that there some different lines you unlocked completed dragoon and there another spot where dialog changes you unlocked smn for cul and drg pre quests they are considered time bubble happened the past ,1
yes certain dialog changes least based job quest the culinarian one specifically doesn change because they locked the point time which the quest was created and since the quest existed before things went down dah isn affected there the part when tataru tries become arcanist and the dialog changes slightly you leveled acn ditto for some yugiri dialog you leveled nin and some heavensward dialog you leveled drg can think any non job quests that affect dialog offhand but some might exist ,-1
 yes several quests will acknowledge that you leveled certain class job you leveled drg estinien acknowledges you fellow azure dragoon the story quests you leveled arcanist the guild leader acknowledges that when tataru goes around trying figure out what she wants class job quests are sort locked time when they were made there are anachronisms due story level cul quests took place long before those events that you mentioned transpired ,1

our gdp numbers are joke ruchir sharma made great point that the financial world become similar nigeria massaging our gdp figures there way are growing and the numbers keep getting revised downwards the imf has already revised our gdp downwards three times there massive mean reversion the base effect wears off there huge difference between dipp fdi numbers and rbi fdi numbers similarly recent article came out showing how fdi has nothing with make india pmo being criticised for being overly centralised which stopping work the govt instead doing real work seems hell bent managing expectations you can micromanage economy the key free market reforms providing free market space and letting the market allocate capital see fit that why people invest places like china micromanaging few multinationals through the investment phase then claiming india open for business will never have the desired effect and most importantly economies are led sme you make easier for one big multinational will make difference but small policy changes which affect thousands sme will really send the economy through the roof you look the ipo market for the last years its been very weak seen very few sme able make that jump this does not bode well going forward you can solely rely large corporations drive the investment cycle have problems everywhere you look except maybe car sales and big billion sales around diwali but seriously agri manufacturing and rate cuts won anything there already overcapacity every industry manufacturing housing edit was going mention the congress plus cow comment but lol see you beat lolol,1
arun shourie now officially persona non grata among modiji fanbois here wait for them call him psic and all kinds other abuses ,-1

for those who want data states are responsible for communal violence india this data tracks years 2011 2014 and doesn make difference who power modi mms ,1
 really amazing how much traction this rising intolerance stuff getting considering how shallow really and the fact that not one the guys behind these protests can give satisfactory explanation for why intolerance has apparently risen overnight and modi blame for all textbook goebbels just repeat the same thing again and again without thinking and becomes accepted fact ,1
lel,0
well modi lovers won agree with your rant but modi lovers also don have the guts rant about those who are returning awards one can prove those protestors are doing wrong ,-1
 either provide data not cases show systemic rise occurrences intolerance zip did pak become what year requires time people who have read observed history know how this starts and you factor all the events govt response and chilling effect yes the right wing craziness increasing are you blind all the social media hate the paki middle class was blind too and see where they are will again remind obc don fall into the trap after muslims your number ,-1
yeah not look history and the 80s and all the bomb blasts that constantly happened and many other things ,1
because modi and his ministers are openly endorsing these communal thugs ,0
the people claiming intolerance have media reports back what you have show for your claim except your rant whole load nothing all see your post ,1
the fact that beef banned shows rising intolerance certain communities who not eat beef then feel the government has validated them enforce themselves onto other communities strongly against the beef ban not because favourite meat but because the divisive and intolerant behaviour approves and the divisive message sends ,1
this comment had posted earlier cents will try explain why think lost people seem quick criticize modi for communal problems india was born and brought mangalore communal tension common there every year used have school shutdown for few days and bajrang dal was and very strong there some small things like muslim boy marrying hindu girl hindu boy marrying muslim girl would tick people off from both sides and shit would escalate out control was from hindu brahmin family and even was afraid bajrang dal when modi came power there was massive rally these nutcase hindu groups many school friends participated this rally unfortunately and people this rally were openly saying things like now you wait and see what happens muslim neighborhoods they all think their time has come they all feel they won touched and that they have the pms support that why they have become extra bold modi responds strongly one incident against right wing just once come out openly and say something throw some these people jail these people will know not with their shit but unfortunately central government hasn done that both sides treat them both equally and throw people from both sides jail that even better but modi needs take strong stance against religious intolerance from both sides not the rise intolerance that the problem the fact that most these extreme right wing crazies think they have centers support and take center silence yes have seen and talked many bajrang dal mangalore and they truly believe and the other communities think they are under attack and also think the center supports the right wing sure center doesn support either side but silence not helping one clear and loud message from modi condemning both sides and rss etc for this will get everyone confidence back that edit lots comments cannot individually reply but some clarification not saying modi responsible not saying has apologize for every incident that crazy and unfair cant hold one person accountable for billion people that humanely not possible but because lot right wing crazies think modi supports them modi comes out and clarifies once and for all people will calm down right wing will know they dont have the support support dont mean legal support states duty many said and the minorities will stop crying that supports them someone below mentioned about discrimination against black community the example when black people went rampage obama did make statement that was not for black people riot like the way they were many people thought obama was support blacklivesmatter because black too but came out and said understands their frustration but was dead against their method showing that frustration actually came out and acknowledged the shitty behavior minority was doing even though black community hardcore supporters his own democratic party just modi coming out and openly criticizing these right wing actions will calm things down certain extent ,1
okay how about this respect your view that things were always like this and you the same for anybody who thinks intolerance the rise have statistics give because don need them myself everything doesn need quantification maybe can feel see news about new sena everyday threatening violence commiting violent act may not the smartest guy but know how india works and expect anybody who has even tidy bit knowledge how india works would know the same someone really believes that these fringe elements aren motivated the fact that people power are the same ideology them and have become more confident well that them that isn enough look some the and mla speeches from the ruling party some even hold highest offices think intolerance the rise have fundamental right have that view same you how about you don question mine and don question yours ,1
there data these matters all about perception when the chief whip amit shah the predominant party power making statements like you with you with pakistan the exact quote was made bihar election rally bjp loses fireworks will off pakistan say intolerance and don tell modi doesn agree with amit shah ,-1

allow little technical analysis computer science there well known paper halpern and moses called knowledge and common knowledge distributed environment pdf they speak hierarchies knowledge and draw distinction between distributed knowledge and common knowledge person may know and may know they have distributed knowledge but may may not know knows that knows that knows that knows common knowledge when everyone knows everyone knows everyone knows that everyone knows that everyone knows and infinitum bear with come why this relevant local mafiosi will want you know dangerous and everyone will know but wouldn want printed newspaper because then everyone will know that everyone else knows this latter state dangerous for him because people feel emboldened something about people will join revolt they know that others will join too which requires common knowledge which why newspapers and the media and large open spaces where crowds can gather have been potent and why free speech considered paramount over claims social order etc where anyone can say anything without fear retribution back the topic the bjp rss combine pro hinduism pro nationalism this common knowledge this emboldens anyone with hindu nationalist agenda whether they are manipur kerala earlier these incidents would written off unconnected but longer consider talk romila thapar has happen under heavy police presence why everyone afraid year old historian mahasabha observe nathuram godses death anniv balidan diwas 1811969 html tribute godse these events are not being coordinated the centre but common knowledge about hindu power the center has ended coordinating many fringe groups into doing their shitty thing not just egregious things like dalit murders riots but the zillions small things that together become bigger and give rise sense increase intolerance even one inclined charitable about the bjp intentions their mere presence the center has woken this immense power and looks like they are either incapable stopping mood both ,-1
 fyi had riots after akhileshji came into govt there within the first years governance are busy dealing with shiv sena entire country peaceful otherwise except for these coward mumbaikars their coward party this news about riots other parts country pure horseshit ,1
your quest for finding statistics prove disprove intolerance futile the perception rise intolerance has become prevalent when people hear the incidents just confirming their opinion the kamandal party being itself with the 2002 modi the helm would agree this unfair assessment modi bjp have not done anything except for few pig headed statements from ministers deserve this spell award wapsi the party doing piss poor job getting the message back development and has been concentrating dog whistling the beef thing claim this some grand leftist media conspiracy malign the good work this government just naive ,-1

 laugh when people jump this bandwagon and say intolerance rising india right wing state the rss the next isis joke you see what all these people want india karma since intolerance the new tag for karma whores locality there are hindu and muslim living peacefully for more than years one dadri does not reflect the entire nation fabric law and order state issue not expect the and individually enforce the law whether you like not the political spectrum has changed and unfortunately the congress mismanagement the nation and minority appeasement has what has made the bjp votebank consolidated remember correctly our previous hardly spoke and yet have never seen much unity among the msm attacking this hypocrisy even more compounded when makes comments such muslims have the first right the countries resources how this not communal and for all those retards saying why india making wrong headlines because any media has nothing except sell negativity for their own commercial benefit whether foreign domestic bring the downvotes ,1
 you see bob told you these dot indians would bitch about they never learn third world man third world that all sayin ,0
biggest enemy india indians making the country shithole and dragging the name the indians the same shithole can live india and now will have issues getting job foreign land hope all the fucking bigot secual anti nationals are happy ,1
 whether agree with them not and even like not damage being done everyone knew the leftist academia not going let without fight ever since bjp got elected even before the elections saw these editorials these very same publications and its not like they are going change their opinions fact that publications like nyt economist guardian huffpost are leftist inclined their respective countries and its only fair they side with the leftists india create narrative that hitler rising from his graves india like faux news propaganda cycle crying from the rooftops that hussein obumber come grab their guns and money give blacks sample the quote from nyt the fact india riven hatred and held hostage bullshit india today far more accommodating and tolerant than india has even been post independence just like more racially accomodating than the jim crow days even with police shootings blacks now how many actual acts intolerance have happened the past one year aside from sound bites two three country billion get fucking perspective nyt and their desi supporters statistical aberration noise and one final thing money begets money the investors dont give shit beef banned some hindu kills muslim remote corner country vice versa long the govt promoted pro business measures which they are money will keep coming ,1
what can say congress left propaganda bearing fruit the nyt editorial you have linked references moody analytics that was hyped indian media but actually not moody ,-1
wow that nyt piece was the new york times editorial board the editorial board composed journalists with wide ranging areas expertise their primary responsibility write the times’ editorials which represent the voice the board its editor and the publisher for piece that purports have the weight the nyt editorial board behind this quite scant detail opinion just lump few things together and hit print ,-1
most indians especially smaller places are inherently racist casteist caste politics ugly reality game both sides play make mistake but sections the msm get particularly agitated when the right wing who are the accused remember the ram leela agitation anna hazare ndtv practically looked the other way they only covered what they did because the event reached shrill pitch can you imagine what role this channel would play there was similar nation wide agitation against the bjp blatant bias against one side the media full thugs senior journalist playing courier pigeons inside the political network act like that just another day work india caste problems have always been ugly the trying build image can get the big leagues but certain class people are holding their personal agenda above the country good all countries have their internal problems usa has their cops minorities issues countries have ton hardliners gaining power because the refugee crisis china has their human rights problem imo unpatriotic wash your dirty linen public thriving india has much better scope for solving its internal problems than poor india where people are each others necks for scarce resources ,-1
 damage being done and this what the political opposition congress and left want they rather destroy india than let ruled some one else not from their persuasion from the day modi got elected congress too has been trying something other stoke disturbances recently they appeared getting hold gujarat through hardick but thankfully that fizzled out then had the assam congress men throwing beef into temple stoke communal passions inb4 someone accuses defending the lynching was crime and needs judged and the guilty punished period ifs and buts point grow some fucking perspective how this country has always had the hindu muslim issue given its history how things were much worse the past and how have progressed point that even its the peace the graveyard its still shaky peace also grow some perspective that this country billion and one two acts happening lawless regions statistical aberration and not the growing intolerance the billion the pundits crying murder studios and media editorials know that but for them its war bjp and reputation india mere collateral damage they can achieve the stabilisation the elected government just don bother denying when have had actual instances opposition mps and leftist academia writing letters stop modi they can that anything can done ,-1
did india say anything when there blatant killings black and racism what about riots over the years hmmm,-1
this what don get how that amit shah and other bjp leaders fringe not you decide saying these things are not damaging and when media reports damaging even selective reporting how media reporting about lynching greater wrong than the actual lynching itself ,-1
does not matter these are all perceptions retards like bakra dutt and assdeep sardesai believe that india practically syria now and rss basically just cancerous version beyond point you cannot fight hyperbole since always based some real facts and oodles creativity there are just couple ways neutralize create enough good solid counter news progress women equality renewable energy etc work killing the base level factual realities perception dirty can fought with strict penalties peeing the streets throwing rubbish the roads etc modi just needs bulk and keep playing his game the game town not the dogs who bark him and small jpg ,-1
 for this reason not opening his mouth adityanath sadhvi prachi mahesh sharma aside the somewhat saner bjp people like shah terms political correctness are having their statements misquoted and taken out context now imagine that happens the prime minister india when speaks within moments india whole will called communal state like isis all initiatives like swach bharat make india gone down the drain modi speaks misquoted doesn willing tolerate and encourage hindu hardliners and remember westerners almost always reads their news from the internet from news sites facebook thing worry about ,1
you should angry amit shah yogi adityanath etc for being such communal pieces shit and modi not saying word the issue rather the western media who report this ,-1
like anybody cares about these news outlets ,0
every party has its own ideals one cannot expect every single political party equivalently secular does seem like representing single community but the end the day they aren revolting against others india the biggest democracy and still surviving peacefully blessing itself ,1

 wouldn say that the fact one could not criticise manmohan singh without backlash that statement true but not for the reasons that are alluded the fact that manmohan singh just wasn popular enough people are very partisan their choices matter the field for example around 2005 some the most heated debates were who was better tendulkar dravid there point voicing ones opinion such environment any topic such discussions just smile nod along and ignore everything that said ,1
such intolerance not new back the 90s when was high school were visiting small town tamil nadu and out shopping with some friends and made funny comment reference jayalalitha shop and was immediately told hush our hosts and once reached home was told that you shouldn say negative things about any politician public because their supporters are mostly goons who would cause problems having grown big city and school where regularly talked about current affairs and the first few minutes the school day were spent discussing the days top news stories was complete shock that you could get into trouble for merely speaking out and then ended moving tamil nadu for college and learnt that you should careful about criticising any tamil movies either you risked running into some violent fans the actors was happy move out there and have not have been the kind social circles where don have worry about speaking mind over the last few years social media has changed all that first started with iac and aap questioning anything about anna hazare and his lokpal was primarily met with name calling once aap came around got worse and then the 2014 campaign started and things just went rapidly downhill during the same period year period our cities have grown rapidly due immigration from smaller towns and villages and internet access which was mostly limited the urban elite became affordable the common man and this kind polarised say anything against favorite leader actor etc and round gang thugs and rough you scenario what most those people grew and for them this par for the course for political discourse and even though they have just found new medium express their views the way they remains the same the moderates will always just fly under the radar and avoid engaging with such elements look the bihar verdict bjp propaganda and their fanbois propagating would have you believe that modi and his plan the only way forward and anyone even questioning anti national and even the exit polls seemed endorse the view that this view was resonating with the population because only people already vocal about their views would readily submit any exit poll but the final results clearly showed that they were all wrong and the majority don care about this brand politics propaganda also there eleanor rooselvent quote great minds discuss ideas average minds discuss events small minds discuss people when have such large chunk the population that barely literate and education system that penalises independent thought you cannot expect have any kind normal debate policies plans with the average indian who raised never question authority status quo but they are definitely smart enough discuss events and how impacts them and react accordingly ,1

this political tribalism not unique the bjp what you think was happening when the aap was making waves before the general elections later the delhi elections every time you expressed scepticism about aap kejriwal your credentials were questioned back look some the earlier threads this sub reddit especially the ones related the delhi elections you will get the exact same feeling the reason why the congress did and does not not have frenzied following because unlike modi aap not recent phenomenon not party that the younger generation immediately relates they dont have charismatic mass leaders who appeal the year olds can out limb and say that most the blind followers both aap bjp this subreddit social media forums elsewhere voted for the first time the last couple years and are largely the age group pretty sure you are one them yourself you talk the slightly older supporters and you will get more objective view ,1

 nor should made feel like outcast because don agree with the majority opinion the love for modi not majority opinion only painted such bjp got majority lok sabha 2014 with vote share absolutely incredible result made possible only because the divided opposition wasted the votes least indian voters don profess any great love for modi they want him his job without preaching morals society ,1

dad senior ips officer with long experience says that this one the most major grievous cases politicians abusing police officer transfers are not uncommon but insults are extremely rare because has consequences where live sps any district would immediately lock the neta who dared tell ips get out and the policemen would give him heartwarming guest treatment the said lockups apparently not only that retarded thug got away with this transferred the ips some remote location where her carrier either ruined she die the hands his goons don know why cannot follow the japanese police model our police still built completely east india company army with minor changes japanese police utterly detached from political control and politician has ever been able influence any extent and their police free arrest rogue politicians without mercy the other hand india there hardly any politician that not rogue yet police either helpless completely under their control ,-1
because you all have your pitchforks ready every moment hard for someone make you people understand you all are bit too much hater generalization because this all who you are everything that politician does say wrong very rarely see you people praise anything remember you all praised politician coz supported doping now you are ready understand this country democracy meaning the politicians are responsible its citizens the bureaucracy judges officers are not answerable people you can not question bureaucrat public because according constitution not responsible you but ministers public servants elected the elected leaders responsibility question and keep checks and balances officials public will question him her not the officials stop hating your politicians this will lead you all nowhere and shows you all not interested democracy but bureaucracy autocratic judiciary not loose faith your politicians because only they are answerable you not any one else what the lady ips officer did was absolute rubbish and what doing condemning the minister blunder she terms should have replied minister like that this not school she should have maintained decorum and her behaviour unfit officer what she did was absolute non sense just because she officer that does not mean that she right and just because vij politician should not ridiculed abused the one who will asked questions and his years report card can and will questioned people not the officers lay down your pitchforks and try understand things before coming judgement ,1

 take this from completely different angle management the politician the senior manager the junior manager the ngp people are the consumers the consumers are complaining cause they received deficient service the junior manager defends her position saying that the customer has not followed the correct procedure the matter has been escalated the senior manager the senior manager asks the junior manager why there has been deficiency service the junior manager again defends her position additionally citing that her hands are tied she does not have powers anything more the senior manager puts the blame squarely the junior manager saying that there lack initiative from the junior manager towards making sure that there good service delivery the junior manager takes one step further saying that the company was fault was the one which promised service delivery this the senior manager enraged and storms out the meeting saying that going recommend the ceo take action against the junior manager now that have take the political parties civil service govt etc etc out the story you can see that what happens every private institution across india including private and mnc would say that this attitude and even cultural social problem india where try and shift the blame others rather than take responsibility for get things done fixed ,1

you don need support party every single issue there was party which was not corrupt economically responsible and socially progressive would totally support reality have choose between corrupt and nepotistic congress and socially regressive bjp not like the other parties are much better than bjp this issue either congress was power for years but did not bother doing anything about section 377 either even now shashi tharoor brought this bill his personal capacity you will find many leaders who personally support gay rights even inside bjp not that matters ,1

that idiotic section 377 not what india needs focus today that cheap move sahshi tharoor tabling this bill without taking account the various sects groups india without any serious debate nationally just show bjp poor light all this aside india needs focus economic growth for the next years and not people rights paper congress kept doing the same thing right after right just kept people relatively poor ,-1
fuck the rss should your mantra bjp small offering that terror group the baghdadi that group bhagwat will ensure that homosexuals will wiped out from this country just like hitler exterminated worse than kill them out was swastika era then germany now india watch out and save yourself you would sent for experimentation nagpur some moderators randia acts behalf rss make sure you don share personal info ,-1
 you haven noticed lot important matters national interest are being held the opposition these matters have taken years hard work and will benefit millions people with what logic did you expect that bjp will support tharoor overnight whims just like that ,1

 addition what you read recommend river fire river water and shin buddhism bits rubble turn into gold both taitetsu unno also the reason why shin buddhist churches are even the because early japanese immigration and later sustained japanese american communities while they were placed internment concentration camps our government during ww2 they are called churches the first place that they could allowed established nation which had prejudice against non christian forms religion the churches continue source support for new japanese immigrants today the emphasis japanese american identity understandable found when going temples like this once they see not just tourist through frequent attendance and participating other activities they hold people get used ,1
amid all the stalling the upper house and the hoopla surrounding the gst bill this was perfect opportunity for bjp capitalize and show congress which the better party but they have pander their regressive religious vote banks and this pretty much what congress wanted when tharoor had tabled his bill ,1
 know many gay people date have yet meet single one who supports bjp among muslim friends the ratio bjp supporters something like out atheists pretty much hate bjp don know many christians but imagine that skewered towards bjp here the thing bjp has very well defined political strategy hardcore hindus will always vote for bjp even modi turns out actually hitler reincarnate they still vote bjp moderate hindus are with the dibilopment targeted them move the needle bjp hope that the hardcore moderate hindus voteshare large enough result victories for them this just execution their political strategy keep the hardcore hindus happy while few moderate hindus will care have had people the moderate hindu camp basically say dibilopment first equality later even facebook wall full comment replies gay friends posts trying justify this ,1
hey don depressed fight for this together you said this just the beginning long road forward ,-1
 sent shashi tharoor tweet and rant whatsapp circles who have social conservatives and big namo supporters and all hear return were crickets chirping hypocrisy much ,1
this pathetic even though their stand party was quite clear from the beginning hope better sense prevails and next one two years the illegality around homosexuality resolved but the meantime there needs societal change the political change will not happen before the social change seems and may wrong there large scale movement around this may that because the status 377 any case the voices for lgbt support need amplified thousand times for reach the deaf ears our politicians ,-1

 this will happen everyday this government slowly losing favor everywhere look bihar gujarat elections the policy looting the people corrupt bjp goons getting exposed now slowly evident matter who you choose when they come power they become corrupt because absolute power corrupts were chanting modi modi 2014 but its just year and have lost all faith this guy ,-1

their voices and acting aren bad who cares they haven had experience before this you have start somewhere something you also failed realize that the actors are actually english this time instead faking english accents ,-1
 know that voice from somewhere shrugs and keeps playing only know the voice actors that seem every single game arr and does not matter how long the voice actor resume are they all sounded mediocre horrendously bad ,-1
all can say maybe those actors that were let were working other projects the time they were needed for and they weren available they had with alternative means that happens lot the business ,1
 concern that the casting change reflects mindset square that western audiences are not interested story and therefore worthwhile redistribution resources would move money away from english voice acting could this could that there are simply not nearly many english vas there are japanese and those who are vas are simply not well known because the role not remotely near prestigious english speaking countries japan this being one the very few times discussion about english voice acting has popped any discussion board anywhere and the relative lack passion getting outside the main post has doubt contributed very valid conclusion that the english audience does not concern itself with english voice acting anywhere near their counterparts japan mindset square that western audiences are not interested story not sure how you leaped this conclusion generally don tie the quality story the voice acting sometimes even live acting unless very bad and this game nowhere near that yet more with plot and visual effects and suspect nowhere near alone this least with western audiences ,-1
 impressed with the amount effort you put into researching all that that being said english voice acting terrible investment while japanese voice acting good one this can seen all asian media including anime and movies the issue due the massive differences language because how drastically the feel the dialog changes translation you could get list actor and still have sound like complete shit good example this can found with english voice casts miyazaki films they are filled with very expensive list actors and the dubbing still kind sounds like shit compared the original ,1
 they simply decided that was not worth continuing with the previous cast proof there are many reasons that could possible that caused them with the new cast old cast busy not much more money spend voice actors actors wanting more money than willing paid etc clearly square treats its western and eastern audiences differently voice actors are treated much differently japan and america frankly surprise anime least the voice actors tend make several times more than any the animators and often more than the higher ups too ,1
 got the feeling that they just went one acting company for which would simpler and significantly cheaper than keeping lots ongoing contracts and possibly better result have evidence for this arr voice track was not memorable and neither don view big deal miss one two especially merlwyb voice actors anime are big deal japan their english knock offs are not there comparison unless trying compete with shrek pixar movie that not going happen ,1
somethign note here that sometimes experience doesn always equal quality you could end with things like miscast misdirect etc and the industry never cultivated newer talent then there point having voice acting industry begin with mean nobody fucking expected cristina vee well that she now iconic and recognizable laura bailey ffs also only narrowing down their experience video games terrible terrible way judging how good they are acting for example raw talent may not always have portfolio but someone notices their voice and gets them gig that one gig the seed that starts their careers and before they know they household name also consider other sources and don just mean the big screen either why don you consider things like theatre plays broadway musicals and the like not everyone has experiences that are recorded dvd some these you have see live even know they exist there reason patrick stewart performances are said have shakespearean vibe them that where majority his experience draws from real unfortunate that ends getting typecasted more often than not waste his potential given what seen out him don narrow your interpretation what can that will only bias your opinion into thinking they not capable enough take this role and besides even they weren experienced they never get chance show what they can you never know how good they could been ,-1
ultimately feel comes down the voice acting scene and how differs between america and japan voice actors japan are idolized and fangasmed over our hollywood actors are and animation and video games are taken quite bit more seriously the eastern market compared the western for the video games part you really only have look south korea and the start the modern sports scene unless voice actor also well known live action star most western individuals would not able name that many voice actors until fairly recently animation the west has been looked down upon lesser art form possibly not even art form all depending who you ask and once again has only been comparatively recently that started seen more valid medium which express visual medium such our voice actor pool quite small now compare the eastern market animation well loved with long storied history that was taken seriously its market more less since the 60s not earlier with the advent televised animation series the voice actor pool for the eastern market huge and often entire career can made single animated series entire career nothing but animation voice work just have less those types actors around and they often have take whatever work comes their way continue their career leading gaps like this more than likely the previous actors were simply unavailable they were looking break out into more serious work the time could the mindset that animation and video game work still isn taken seriously the west though believe that slowly changing with pixar dreamworks could you say that square thinks don care about story ultimately think the problem lies with and our dismissal animation until fairly recently and the mindset western audiences regards cartoons there even problem all that has lead this gap ,1

put this way when have such negative stigma for english dubs japanese works not surprising that square enix doesn feel like worth investing much money into hiring voice actors voice lines that may never heard ,-1
honestly feels like they trying get new blood use regulars actually inclined worry less since has much higher quality voice direction than arr did with even portion the talent being well known ,1
 think would rather have consistency than talent and can explain why consistency makes for good experience moving forward suddenly changing voice acting casts ruins some the immersion voice actor dialogue isn working its the sound designer work with the voice actor fix the problem its the same problem with movies where actors get the blame for bad acting when the director the one calling the shots and giving the take the thumbs ,1
 feel that bit stretch draw that conclusion think the decision recast the english voice actors was more directorial decision rather than financial one the sudden shift can better seen the direction how square wanted english eorzea actually sound rather than just bunch american voices and accents accents thats the real hint all this heavensward you can really see how people from different places eorzea have different accents with their speech help stress the cultural differences notice how rauhban and ilbred both talk and pronounce way different from the rest the dah cast better yet notice how like half the cast just the voices from xenoblade they wanted more english cast american one ,1
snake gaius van baelsar want hayter mmo now ,0
honestly having not heard the japanese voice work the game can weight one way another what astounds the sheer number people who think japanese sounds better default most the time japanese voice acting too fluid sound natural often missing delaying noises that most japanese use even when they don need delay their statement combine that with the lack social niceties most japanese dialogue animation and games and just feels bad take for example the animation rune soldier louie the english voice acting that far superior the japanese voice acting though most otaku term really hate use would argue the opposite from ignorance ,1
 remember reading they decided outsource their different studio for heavensward very likely that the one that recorded for xenoblade seemingly the last minute they probably did because was convenient for them terms costs and management honest with the exception few very good vas gideon emery will forever missed didn lose out much heavensward has been very solid compared arr with most the vas from xenoblade which had very high qulity dub itself joining the team ,1
 prefer lot the new voices the old voices tbh just because voice actor isn famous doesn mean they not good and gives newer chance get their feet the door difficult industry edit also the majority the casting changes are because timed contracts wearing out ,-1
 disliked the voice acting arr much changed any other language but english don think much that they invest heavily japanese seiyuu but that the industry much more established japan seiyuu are also big draw for japanese players and some non japanese guessing whereas only know taliesin jaffe name and that from critical role ,1
 thought shtola sounded familiar ,1
 feel like that utterly bizarre conclusion draw the voice acting heavensward not bad any stretch the imagination and fact think lot people would argue better are the voice actors well known maybe not but anything more inclined give pat the back for giving new blood opportunity start getting some notches their belt big title rather than keep replying actors who are already established not mention honestly hearing the same every game can get tiresome itself ,1
well the thing that moved from mostly american based cast arr many whom were only vas anime video games british based cast comprised actors who are mostly and film actors tracy ann oberman merlwyb for example actress the and was several episodes doctor who among other shows gemma whelan igeyorhm plays yara greyjoy game thrones matt stokoe elidibus from the musketeers and misfits colin ryan alphinaud played major characters two series the leonardo and hounded anything the voice cast technically more famous the sense that they actors who are and film actors rather than just vas they just mostly happen british rather than american and therefore most people don recognize their names this actually more line with japan voice actors ,1
voice acting huge field general they don have out their way for decent vas not much the west they want talent compared they would have hire aaa celebrities just like disney and pixar when they have their animated films ,1

one the best tricks got for coming with npc names the fly looking around the room spotting something and making play its name for instance have laptop stand using right now and has the brand name griffin from which can pull the names grif fin firg riffi nirg etc also have monitor front giving the names monty tor oni nom itor etc ,1
another good source for names found the galactic campaign guide from wotc obviously for the d20 system but has whole section with names and name generating guidelines for whole bunch species ,1
 never without names sheet part any session prep create list about theme appropriate names and keep next ever comes can glance down and instantly have players seem love because they once said love how every character has name you can make names the fly envy you can make entire plot arcs and weave storylines the fly but names are hard for lol,1
valo dissitad kal terax sado chance kyp galia rhel vendar tex 417 these are the names current pcs year campaign run you want archetype character traits could share those too feel free use the names npc names find names actually make great sources npc names simply because much thought goes into selecting them usually ,1
 also bad sci names the fly all make names week and keep them pice paper text doc that way you eventually have like names waiting for you any given time and you just resupply your list between sessions ,1

 didn vote for bjp either but was all ready vote for them 2019 because realized any government will need ten years show changes unlike feel statements like this country fucked over reaction yes have had quite few headline grabbing events the past one month but none them barring the haryana incident perhaps affected anything more than the population there whole wide world outside what the media covers and things are improving there but agree where coming from and truly pissed the way the government has been derailing its own mandate reforms our country are such low hanging fruit that the government could have done nothing but the bare minimum technology deployments and they would have been back power 2019 now not really sure have never ever felt such viciousness from any party its supporters was not alive during indira gandhi tenure would any day take scam over almost the entire population feeling victimized brain washed one way the other ready for third front 2019 true reforms will much slower but india has grown earlier when the government was auto pilot can continue run that way instead risking civil war something ,1

 through some clever book keeping and financial witchcraft the managers have been sitting this pile rotting loans they didn have any reason tell the higher ups about the terrible situation they were until rajan sent them that notice and forced them declare these bad loans not possible for the manger hide bad loans periodical review all the accounts done many the bad loans have till now been prevented from being classified npas refinancing them with short term loans avoid defaults the rbi has now asked them classify even such loans bad loans also under consortium lending even one member bank recognizes account npa all the banks are now required treat the account npa which was not the case earlier both these are major causes for the higher npa numbers the top management which responsible for the current mess and not just the front end manager who most the cases just following orders from the top ,-1

 kingfisher airlines borrowed amount 7000 crore from banks these loans were declared npa and the recoverable amount has come mere crore figure how much will recovered from the lakh crore the reason why this happened because mallaya used the trademarks and labels kingfisher collateral with the banks but the value these trademarks crashed when kingfisher went bankrupt now this goes without saying that brand name would lose its value goes bankrupt why did banks took the risk taking kingfisher trademarks collateral the first place when the loan was being taken for the vary same corporation the bench headed chief justice asked all there this indian express report well that strange supreme court bench drawing its conclusions from newspaper report ,-1

 can add few points the banks dad chief manager public sector bank municipal town based branch managers chief managers don like having npas their books either the problem stems from the zonal level the zonal manager assigns quarterly yearly loan targets individual branches applications for larger and possibly good loans that are forwarded the zonal managers sit their desks for several weeks the borrower usually moves private bank now all that left smaller loan applications from shaky applicants local politicians who wants build schools engineering colleges and activists who would threaten write the this happened lot during the era the zonal management despite being sloppy still expects the branch managers meet the targets bms give the loan and hope would not become npa before they get transferred that the live bomb passed the new guy with bit negotiation with the auditing team and the zonal management you can avoid declaring few loans npa for bunch quarters and don even want speak about the crazy ones that retire branch managers they loaning spree ,-1
while bad paper the current scenario actually better than expected the fact that banks have bad loans ancient fact life these loans extend many many places from large firms small farmers was always expected that some government would have intervene ecentually fix this the nda who has handle and fully expect them handle the issue itself resolved the bureaucrats and the bankers with the goi firmly the driving seat but the issue always the release bank funds largesse mainstay indian politics one form the other one the unspoken rules the game far the divestiture psus stronger oversight capital norms means constrain loans will help the clean banks will good thing and will allow for loan cycle occur the base healthy banking sector which can handle any future negative shock honestly this business expected good that people are upset but being upset won make difference since this essentially cyclical feature the larger economy and our banking private network rules which are followed divestment distance between center politics and psu management are the cure and they been the cure since the reform process started but haven been completed ,1

great writeup thanks question big corporates say vijay mallya take huge loans and then are not able pay back and thus the write off what does the law here can catch the culprits and send them jail probably auction the properties that were kept guarantee while taking loan haven heard bigshot except sahara who sent jail for not paying back the money ,1
 always post this lecture article rajan the topic attitude borrowers towards the bank www outlookindia com article need change mind set 292696 the average interest rate loans the power sector today even while the policy rate the difference also known the credit risk premium largely compensation banks demand for the risk default and non payment since the unscrupulous promoter hides among the scrupulous ones every businessperson tainted the bad eggs the basket even comparing the rate the power sector loan with the average rate available the home loan obvious that even good power sector firms are paying much more than the average household because bank worries about whether they will recover loans reforms that lower this 300 basis point risk premium power sector loans vis vis home loans would have large beneficial effects the cost finance perhaps much more than any monetary policy accommodation also highlights general problems like regulatory forbearance which was put place for temporary use but has been abused again and again www livemint com opinion rbctubqqfy7moqw4uytq7h why regulatory forbearance must end html recovery rates psbs are lower than private sector banks but the latter isn all that higher either need better bankruptcy laws deal with this kumbhakaran you may want add these links you find them useful insightful ,1
 top vijay mallya just resigned from united spirits and got payout million rs515cr not pedantic but couldn resist because intermittent ocd sorry how can they ask the banks waive off loans worth lakhs crores without having estimate how the big defaulters are the banks know who are the borrowers and rbi does not this not issue secondly the loans are not being waived cancelled forgiven forgotten that wrong and dangerous word use this context the loans are being written off what that means you say earlier you post that once the borrower has failed service the loan willingly due the things can control the banks write off called provisioning could partial full that their and balance sheet show the true reflection their own health rajan pushing for aggressive approach you mention later the post that does not mean that the borrower walks away the banks continue make efforts recover the money through notices public shaming selling assets borrower change management restructuring conversion into equity court cases sale loan arcs etc loan part that has been written off the bank and the bank manages recover the amount written back and becomes profit for that year interesting example here would the business cycle mid 90s early 2000s that time also the banks faced huge defaults and were actually worse shape than today but fortunately the global commodity prices shot through the roof and most the bank clients turned around and banks averted disaster most borrowers were commodity companies that time steel cement etc this time this not likely happen the mess wouldn clear itself they could have taken measure make sure the banks are being prudent when handing out money not only did they not take these measures they actually forced the banks lend their favored borrowers one the biggest defaulter unitech which people say gandhi family company rumor don ask for source group another big defaulter was close bsp jindals congress hcc pawar dlf huda vadra and they will benefit immensely from this loan write off and bailouts the government banks play the book which big ask they need not seize their fucking assets they have given personal guarantee seize their homes too what happens next short term government puts equity into the banks and they somehow survive medium term hopefully this government puts professional management into the top layers the bank board and cmd and the rot contained happening bank baroda but again tall ask long term the relative size the psu bank will shrink pvt banks will become bigger one last point why are politicians reluctant reforming privatizing the banks because that the biggest tool granting favors corporates who turn are the biggest political donors the last last point there silver lining the bank problem stock problem the loans already given are going bad and need deal with what the system does not have fortunately the flow problem new money coming into the system and the investment cycle picks will have the money fund ,1
bailouts and capital infusement are not the same the former involves the treasury buying loans from banks with cash that they inturn got from taxes borrowing through bonds the latter involves the govt investing the banks that owns acquire more assets nothing about loans this alone makes rest the argument invalid ,1
 don speak excretion while eating meh agree with your parents that while perfectly normal topic makes want not eat food due the imagery that pops head try eating yellow dal when talking diarrhea ugh ymmv though ,1

most these bad loans are secured loans meaning there property company assets that are mortgaged right now pain the ass for banks recover npa loans through the sarfaesi act hope the rules are simplified that willing defaulters can face the consequences they deserve ,1
 blame raghuram rajan only doing what should have been done long time back npas were allowed unchecked most them would have eaten the system and even more bailout money later date now are already global recession slow growth this the right time absorb the losses rather than carrying forward and having crash bull market upa yes they made hay with jobless inflationary growth while pocketing huge sums between themselves too bad there political accountability the least should pressure them stop putting obstructions the reform process looking you tathagatasatpathy kumbhakaran nda capital infusion psbs required offset the shitstorm see the bob feb jump share price nse bankbaroda this was because they declared huge amounts npa now this one bank which won need any bailout the near future all banks must come clean with much npa they can clean this combined with the bankrupty bill will allow quick cleanup larger than usual recovery cases where assets are still there and can move with clean conscience banks yes while the systems there are still alright banks need get rid front desks which give loans for bribes this should simple task look the list approving officers finds officers whose sanctions have disproportionately gone the red fire them put cases against them and let handle the rest big corporations yes same the officers above find chronic defaulters black list them file cases against them appropriate and let appropriate authorities handle the rest common man yes there was post yesterday asking for ideas how the common man can help india grow don give take bribes simple that and this probably harder than the above ,1

south korea and japan are the most developed countries asia india would lucky like them the delusion about how well india doing compared countries like south korea japan and the this thread astounding india not doing well comparison any these countries virtually every metric ,1
 colony for japan has nothing with freedom speech religion expression same for malaysia and south korea whose student protests were mainly against the yes singapore version democracy authoritarian spirit and curbs some freedoms but this only becomes relevant the government becomes evil enough warrant the exercise these freedoms this might also hold for the uae and what happened turkey basically what people fear will happen india under the rss ,-1
 pakistan virtual military dictatorship just discovered there word for such state khakistocracy ,-1
worst offender turkmenistan ,-1
 completely agree with ,1
 humble opinion those institutions are not creation the founding fathers they are result the rich diversity india india had oppressive dictatorship type leadership the number separatists movements would much higher pretty much separatists every state the only reason there aren more separatist movements that the various parties have hope that they will get chance power years think the emergency has continued longer think india would have further split the only way govern this large country democracy any other types governing methods would result many more separatist movements with democracy comes all other pillars democracy like freedom speech and independent press ,1
that all being undone the retards power today soon will just another shit hole like pakistan ,-1
 middle east lol fucking lmao ,1
sanghi downvoting brigade was thing before lol sabha elections congi downvoting thing now don know how many people read randia but curious they really take seriously ,1
 think should careful when comparing india and china they don have absolute freedom speech true however the modern states india and china started the roughly the same gdp per capita but they have roughly five times bigger economy now what trying say people china may not have the kind freedom but they have food for everyone and that quite notable achievement ,1
but you can get killed for eating beef hindustan ,-1
don forget bhutan has its game point but pretty rotten once you look past the happiness quotient absolute monarchy significantly low development compared surrounding regions that entire refugee fiasco the 1990s when they basically threw out fifth the population that said you are stretching quite bit for japan both places especially the presence there for reason and singapore most people there are completely with the facto dictatorship who are judge them needless say all three are doing ridiculously well any nitpicking would very bad case sour grapes turkey problems are very recent you also left out taiwan which has very few issues and doing very well all this reason pat ourselves the back many these countries are doing better than some cases remarkably better doing better than most western countries the development front absolutely burstling wrt both technologically and artisitically and has enormous soft power asia all this despite being poor fuck not too long ago densely populated and not all resource rich ,1
just imagine had right wing been this powerful 1947 would have been royally fucked the cast has been set our institutions and polity are largely secular given india education level now and diversity bjp pip dream are just sand castles but just hope some good come out ,1
you right you don rampant practices untouchability cracking down free expresssion and the fostering religious extremism major political parties what joke ,1
 don like the hey not perfect but look all these other assholes better than argument why not compare ourselves the champions freedom like switzerland usa the scnadinavian countries our target shouldn better than our poorly performing neighbors but there the mantle with the greats the world and miles from that target right now ,1
 all need some optimism ,0
 that can call modi moron apparently can call him that now ,-1
also the clean separation between armed forces and the government ,1
 turkey edrogan baby hitler south korea pretty much colony with 50k american troops also read about student marches against government crackdown criticism japan another colony with thousands permanently stationed american troops you are being little harsh these countries ,1
this exactly what been thinking since long time over the years heard stories the form whatsapp group forwards discussion and facebook chains where you read how nehru was dick how gandhi ordered hanging bhagat singh and now you say nehru was good you called congress chut you won respect what nehru did what the legacy gandhi was every year right wing group stays power back year terms freedom expression and personal liberties fear that the time bjp voted out would made very deep damage our view freedom not permanent one sad that are the minority these days ,1
 not sure where begin you start off with nice statement about our founding fathers and looks nice when taken face value but when picked apart this not that much difference from very hollow india bestest every1 else worstest rhetoric freedom expression not everything and your post does not seem only about foe you are looking countries that have undemocratic regimes and making the claim that india better because has democracy not think many people disagree with the idea democracy itself your criticism japan and south korea makes sense all for the most part you are making huge generalizations about countries using single phrase you are looking long periods history and making judgements based their worst times not necessarily the present this particularly true both japan and south korea what matters the here and now middle east lol you are dismissing entire region with just lol care elaborate closet hatred for the muslim world because does show are you one those hypocritical liberals who see hinduism somehow innately more peaceful and superior where islam just one those evil modern religions that hinduism should never follow elsewhere the thread you just outright dismiss latin america because didn even bring latin america which keeps going from one military dictatorship another there are many indians who would give arm and leg live many the countries you have listed people start making such generalizations about india matter how truthful you will probably call them racist pakistani ignorant westerner lets give shot india 3rd world nation with religion with many problems that condones the oppressive social hierarchy caste institutionalizes misogyny and rape culture rampant corruption every level criminal mafia colluding with politicians and the police all over the country rule law that exists only name country filth and dirtiness everywhere sectarian conflict where hundreds die regularly villages living the stone age frighteningly low levels literacy and education and judiciary that both sluggish and corrupt the country beholden the mob and democracy merely thin varnish largely illiberal and sectarian mish mash communities that hate each other has some the worst average incomes and quality life standards the entire world even the government technically protects you with its great constitution becomes moot because society itself will lynch you how that for freedom expression try telling the families rationalists who got murdered try telling the same the jnu students the victims religious riots your post can summarized india better than countries worse than india yeah what that can call modi moron rahul pappu and kejri khujliwal and that there will knocks door for night fact don appreciate all does not really work out like that the real world maybe reddit you are safe unrelated modi but number states india people get arrested for social media posts two women arrested for facebook post mumbai shutdown granted bail html india professor held for cartoon ridiculing mamata asia india 17699304 does not matter the constitution protects you because society will not politicians religious groups and fanatics will able cause harm you before you even file fir and then dispose all the evidence justice will never happen compared democracies the developed world india still has very long way you strike person who not particularly well informed about the world and sounds like classic upper middle class indian liberal fact far say you are not that well informed about india either ,1
pretty weak points against japan and south korea some extent you have got there also you forgot mongolia,-1
and that why friend should fight for even slightest attack freedom speech nip the bud they say the reason that you allow government meddle with slightly within time will loose entirely for example had not fought hard against free basics our net neutrality would have certainly gone its not that don appreciate our freedom rather value much that don want lose ,1
what people don understand that india full fledged democracy with billion people thats like having serve 50000 computers with just one server all the same time and usa over there having problems with what about 300 million people mean come india managing people efficiently considering all the factors but wait you say china has more people but china dictatorship they tell you something you you can that india india actually doing well and even with such diverse population civil war has never been sparked thats not robust government don know what ,1
most your info about other countries seems come from 8th grade politics text seems even the first point china being oppressive well the truth not that oppressive now just the other day they realeased book owner who criticised ccp was released after questioning pakistan islamic democracy whatever india insists also china currently considered better place live than india don understand why pakistan miltary bad thing southe east and middle east countries laughs india for the same reasons you have listed and are currently war with each other whatever you insist sks consider americans there blessing influence japanese life minimal the best also they are still protecting from ,1
bangladesh has seen its share dictatorship also its army killed its founding father ,-1
 that can call modi moron rahul pappu and kejri khujliwal and that there will knocks door for night fact don appreciate all you sure about that lad html ,-1
had nehru died early jinnah india wouldn have been too different from many countries listed above ,1
add indonesia under suharto philippines under marcos and the likes idi amin and mugabe africa even south america new democratic institutions,1
 also say that most western democracies have claimed these ideals equality freedom expression human rights time peace and prosperity now when they being tested well know the reality usa was quick abandon human rights and legal procedures pretty quickly after europe now seeing humanitarian and economic crisis with joblessness the rise and suddenly all sorts right wing nationalist parties have come the fore been dealing with lot more shit for lot longer while maintaining relatively peaceful multicultural society and making progress something carry forward ,1
 think the fact that most our history books end 1947 does not help reading india after gandhi these days and the amount hard work and intelligence put create democratic country where everyone equal has given new sense respect for the country and its beliefs ,1
these things look good paper not practiced actual try calling modi moron rahul pappu and kejri khujliwal with your legit facebook account ,-1
 agree however dont think japan deserves that list nither and singapore who are decide what form gov the best its working for them and the people are happy then great peoples happiness matters more than fos whatever other freedoms ,1
modi baare main kuch nahi bolne ,1

modi hasn still released his roll number for rest all bullshit ,0
fake degree fake entire political science lol ,-1
the least the degree looks fishy jumla best looks like coverup given modi track record education first claimed that was university topper then the universities and pmo started blocking rti requests and then has kept quite all these days before this degree was shown wont surprised this comes out fake ,1
 refusing comment which weird bjp has played itself which also weird there are oddities the certs relating names and course names which also weird ideally would compare with other certs issued the same period for names fonts and roll numbers the roll number register combo should allow take stand which has not done double weird know doubting anything right would mean bhakts stuffing any open mouth with laddus abuse you dont ask question but somehow should wait for more details from the guys that did the issuing the certificates records room needs put under surveillance summer too much stake things are getting hot ,-1
 will better the rti queries are answered rather than press conferences that will give ring authenticity the degrees and shut everyone forever ,1
call biased but just can buy that modi studied maybe some fakirchand college something associated with but certainly not the major colleges that said kejriwal top standard education has not really made him wiser person imo should have atleast confirmed his suspicions before launching all out attack politics makes the fools look saints and the wise look retards ,1
has also given the approval that the degree original ,1
 one finds weird that the degree was awarded for entire political science ,-1
 man who actually gives funda about cosmetic surgery ganesha head cant more than 10th pass for and from gujarat univ cant believe for one sec,1
actually there should reasonable and substantial reasons suspect modi degrees the first place the aap have not proved that they have reasonable doubt but merely threw some allegations and are now stonewalling since the relevant degrees have been made public also the reasons why aap rti applications were turned down were because exhaustive requests that are simply tedious and without point like asking for the original application form modi etc this similar frivolous vexatious litigations that simply waste time and frustrate the defendants and have other objectives aap trying throw much muck see something sticks modi ,1
 predicted finally delhi university has confirmed the details just gujarat university had earlier delhi university clarifies modi was awarded degree 1979 html this should make everything clear normally however this whole drama due politics rather than any genuine concern over the degree expect congress and aap will just make the low effort argument that all this evidence fake cook some truly fake evidence their own and keep copy pasting these same allegations till the media gets tired ,1
 unfortunate that have clarify narendra modi qualifications shame that have clarify why unfortunate shameful what bad about asking for citations ,-1
 was right when kejriwal upped the ante and showed the country how petty can even over non issues finally the degree has been reveled dispel all doubts wasn expecting amit shah personally get involved though the bjp should have asked some delhi state leader like harshvardhan show this just giving kejriwal unneeded legitimacy national politician way achieved his objectives with this drama ,1
 literally degree who the fuck cares you have degree not can you even get employed with all for academic research and the arts but has zero impact one ability perform competently ,1
goddam kejriwal pulling some donald trump level shit here ,-1
fucking madarchods are now claiming that the degree forged top kek ,-1
 really hoped that the bjp ministers had better things than respond some stupid trolling kejriwal the common man doesn give shit about collage degrees real fake ,-1
 this whole degree fiasco don understand one thing have many almost illiterate politicians mean take sonia for moment she herself has idea what are her degrees but look the respect she has our country because gandhi dynasty sure there not going essay competition next election unless that what kejri bhai trying and kejri bhai won win that either you look politics only modi far far ahead from kejri bhai for one knows how run state the very least which think kejriwal don want only want sit the center before starts culminating corruption from country may abusing contest might see him clear winner ,1
the degree displayed may fake may not whichever you believe largely about your political leanings absolutely sure much more needs released like other documents which show modi registered external student etc and verification that the degrees shown are real and not fake and bjp may agree allow that too soon however all this sideshow with real relevance unless there forgery involved doubt that ,1

 bjp congress secretive team players not single word about the fcra amendment was spoken that day just like that super important law that will change how our political parties are funded was accepted the lok sabha proof any needed that bjp congress are different from each other they join hands and throw out democracy benefited them the ‘jumla’ that escaped not just jumla but the likes scam that this very bjp govt chased congress out power 2005 then modi abruptly announced that the gujarat state petroleum corporation gspc had discovered trillion cubic feet gas basin that the bjp promptly renamed the deendayal west area block which would generate revenue worth lakh crore for india everyone including the state and central administrations well subject experts was astonished this fantastic claim true such find would have made india energy self sufficient must for any country aspiring for super power status modi’ announcement therefore generated euphoric excitement and even shifted the narrative from him being the alleged mastermind the 2002 riots potential prime ministerial candidate fact given how events unfolded abundantly clear that the announcement like everything else modi does was just another exaggerated publicity stunt modiji pays heed exclusively his own mann baat thus ignored the field report and forced gspc ahead with the project because this gspc borrowed nearly 000 crore from different public and private sector banks and what does india have return nothing but the issue not just about modiji’ gaseous exaggerations also about diversion public funds and corruption after coercing gspc ahead with drilling basin modi forced partner with company named geo global now here’ the interesting bit geo global was reportedly incorporated just six days before the agreement with gspc the time entering into the agreement with gspc geo global’ capital was reportedly measly 200 week after the agreement its capital mushroomed 000 crore its report for the year ended march 2015 tabled state assembly this year cag had pulled gspc for its lack experience overseas operator the delay execution the work committed resulted cost escalations overseas blocks result the company had incurred expenditure 757 crore for surrendered blocks which 734 crore has been written off the apex auditor noted was this public money diverted fund modi ’ extravagant 2014 election campaign does this not merit independent high level judicial probe and even more interestingly when the screws were tightened vijay mallya for defaulting 9000 crore why gspc not being subject similar treatment why that instead its managing director was rewarded with appointment the director the national informatics centre state petroleum corporation deity gspc however desperately the bjp may sycophantically defend modi the bitter reality that under him corruption was rampant gujarat consider how gave 250 acres land restricted wildlife zone cronies the current gujarat for less than crore html similarly modi gave public land for the mundra sez ece which was worth 1500 per square metre for pittance anything between that why for years the cag was deliberately denied access numerous files gujarat and that also why under modi lokayukta was not appointed for years his avatar prime ministerial candidate modi had famously argued “main khata hoon khaane deta hoon” seems the truth different reports cag gspc 2016 20public sector undertakings report 2016 pdf cag gspc 2015 pdf cag gspc 2011 pdf ,1

 need strong national party keep the ever expanding bjp check last checked congress was the strong national that needed checked for corruption and abuse power,1
more than strong opposition india needs sensible opposition who don oppose bills because they want make the ruling party look bad when the next elections come even the gandhis are gone their lackies will still remain would prefer complete overhaul the congress party ,1
yes definitely upa cabinet was much better than the current nda cabinet with the dynastical leadership that have qualms with people have chosen bjp predominantly for its leader namo and rejected the congress for similar reason they say army sheep lead lion better than army lions lead sheep ,1
congress has other leaders well like digvijay kapil sibal the choices lol ,1
they have and get some fresh face otherwise bjp going power forever ,1
yes would definitely consider voting for congress right now with its dynasty not even option can say will definitely vote for congress pragmatically would see who will replace the gandhis and what views they espouse myriad issues but expect dynasty less congress would match own center right views ,1
 wouldn mind voting for congress since that would mean less stringent rules government offices like used congress days more online tracking work done and other would make goverment jobs fun again ,1
 have always felt india any democratic country needs strong opposition india needs strong congress but india does not need the gandhis gandhi free congress not good enough for vote for the congress congress also needs project strong leaders ,1
 the leader shashi tharoor think about but long the stupid family around won even think voting for them ,-1
 not worried about bjp growth they had win assam assam just another hindutva laboratory bubbling under the surface like karnataka and gujarat were especially with the bangladeshi bogeyman what worried about 2019 because bjp only achievement this term has been opposition while the country wants shove them out bihar and delhi lossew the states that were crucial them winning being prime indicators there doesn seem any alternative ,1
this post smells journalist shit ,-1

yes think kicking the gandhis out and seriously reinventing themselves after the lessons they hopefully learned this time round would improve the party significantly ideal world though which this not mind would consider realistically would probably wind voting for independent candidate ,1
gandhis are not the problem with congress they are merely the mascots congress steeped corrupt people from bottom ranks the top the entire congress party was die and fresh new untainted people were start new congress might consider them but until they have the likes pawars scindias singhs shuklas basically their entire leadership congress will keep looting india fuck that even when these shitlords are not power they keep corrupting the system from ministers they become brokers for corrupt babus you need permit something illegal meet with digvijay singh hand him briefcase cash and get your work done the right babu office ,-1
 would you consider voting for the congress the dynasty gone this will never happen has been evident even from the recent loss they had having said that would still skeptical vote for them even after they eliminate the dynasty gandhis would still indirectly controlling their leaders when they come power their reach and influence within the congress cant eliminated totally ,-1
 will never vote for congress bjp ,0
 hindu feel that the secularism politics has often become tool for minority appeasement hold the view that indian culture inherently tolerant and secular don indulge conversion and believe that god can attained though many ways the same cannot said the abrahamic faiths who proclaim exclusivity and indulge conversions family itself has been victim where one relatives converted for reasons unknown bjp the only viable alternative who seem secular while preserving our traditions they don seem extreme painted the liberals and leftists seriously feel our population will echo sentiments and remain true bjp unless they indulge extreme corruption bigotry ,1
this moot point gandhi mukt congress likely dmk free the karunanidhi family rjd without lalu prasad yadav and his sons for national comparison bjp without rss and give the gandhis too much importance congress has lot other things wrong with them policies massive corruption political opportunism over national interests etc the blame for this also goes various second rung and regional leaders can replace them all ,-1
not million years their leftist economic policies drove our economy into the ditch and kept indians poor even bjp isn good enough but least they aren viciously and blindly destructive these traitors ,-1
gandhis plus all the top stooges like digvijay chidu etc yea looks like never voting congress ,1
 india seriously needs strong opposition for our democracy remain vibrant india seriously needs well informed voters who have got some thinking capacity their own and have guts call bullshit face,1
indian politics ever changing but guess used the idea that the congress will hang somehow they can manage reinvent themselves completely like political parties other bipartisan systems have managed they would have vote that would involve complete removal and prosecution the old guard and dynasty and emergence new youth leaders whoever taps the youth vote actual youth would well imo the situation stands now would vote for shashi tharoor assumed leadership and put his own people visibly ,1
 need strong national party keep the ever expanding bjp check last checked congress was the strong national that needed checked for corruption and abuse power,1
 vote for hindutva unless congress can guarantee that never vote for edit wow downvotes for honest answer ,1
hopefully congress should not replaced another corrupt party they must stay with their development agenda but less likely seeing their arrogance ,-1
 would vote congress they start leaning more pro free market with their economic policies they did well upa and early 90s however lately they have gone too far left for with stuff like the gas subsidy mnrega etc etc gandhis are ruling not ,1
the gandhis are the only factor keeping them together with them gone the congress would immediately break into dozens splinter groups heck the congress loses few more elections especially the next lok sabha elections might happen with the gandhis still present ,0
the way bjp has reached out the educated crowd and their commitment robust party leadership unparalleled don think congress can the near future get anywhere near bjp work ethics and determination ,1
 the gandhis are gone you won have congress they are the glue holding the party ,0
 way the minority thing really creeps out cant vote for congress for blindly supporting minorities have seen the reservation quota politics lot against the congress party this agenda ,1
how come there was such alarmism about strong opposition while congress was ruling india for years mani shankar aiyar pointed out congress still strong ever think need credible opposition the congress and they should cut down size bjp doing good job that ,1

there have been some immediate improvements booking railway tickets much more faster and convenient compared 2013 all round improvements railway infrastructure and cleanliness almost every place visited last years getting that mudra loan very easy lot people know have taken those have close family friend involved some high level business according him and his friend circle dealing with ministries much more streamlined and without bribing endless line random babus contacted most ministries like railways education power sports and others are very responsive and helpful have personal experience with power according people point getting business clearances much easier and clean now can expect see the medium term positive effect ground next years real estate archaic before personal opinion but lot more individuals are asking for white money don know the reason pace construction roads and number neglected areas like himachal pradesh arunachal pradesh madhya pradesh has picked lots going road expansion and upgrade projects fast track back village even the poorest people are now carrying atm cards lot them had bank accounts earlier but they were hardly ever used except for some pensions remittance from family now these folks are taking some interest banking and transfers from government ration cards shops village and nearby have much more streamlined distribution now what don like are those random taxes and cesses ,1
 railway experience has improved extent that was hard expect years back booking ticket has improved you can argue about this but this experience stations are being built where required and they are cleaner and look better than before train compartments are cleaner quick response team have not experienced but citing examples twitter responses passport service everything available online agents are required and information very clear and the mark you choose options for the questions they ask determine what documents will required and then they display final list documents and also mention detail what each document means avoid any confusion you select the time and reach there minutes before the given time you are out minutes before the scheduled time you are sent sms reminder once passport process starts you are sent status update regular intervals friend experienced all job opportunities you can also argue endless here but mentioning first hand experience here the amount startups are seeing now days was never seen before earlier right here india used discuss that india needs startup environment now that here people are trying point problems that but here understanding that many startups are coming because funds are available market and because lot weird laws are removed modi government one law was that for every funding startup government will tax the amount that was stupid another law was that when acquisition happens those getting their shares sold will have pay tax government another stupid law good redundance this has created lot job opportunities and that too with salary perks that weren available before cleanliness see roads stations streets cleaner than before could due citizens awareness government efforts but swachcha bharat abhiyan surely has impact feels good have cleanliness around cam not give exact measurement this impact terms money ,1

firstly just wanted say heart goes out all the victims this tragedy could not even imagine being family member affected this event you live the orlando area please look into blood donations desperately needed far how the repercussions this event politically the and around the world think this event firstly will single handedly give the presidential election over trump this event plays exactly into the rhetoric has been using for months about the threats that radicalized muslims pose the regardless this event does not help out hilary the establishment the least makes look like the establishment and monitoring agencies was asleep the wheel being that this omar killer was already being investigated the fbi mateen orlando killer html before this attack far internationally think this will only push voters britain even more towards exiting the this will make britons even even further skeptical about being forced accept refugees brussels especially the most recent news about the potential outcome betting odds move favor brexit leave tops poll odds move favor brexit leave tops poll 469262 this sentiment may also trickle down into more countries well especially eastern europe and france specifically who will very much empathize with this attack would not the least surprised this cascaded into full fledged failure the european union the very least the dissolution the schengen zone overall hope that discussion this incident doesn just descend into pathetic gun rights gun law debate that really not even remotely the meat and potatoes the crisis issue here especially the light that isis has claimed responsibility for this attack seems their usefulness easily subverted determined individuals terrorists and attackers who want commit acts violence will able get guns matter what the laws are anywhere the world calculated driven well funded murderous and resourceful terrorist organizations have respect for gun laws that important realize gun laws didn stop bataclan nor charlie hebdo nor all the murders chicago every nite amongst many other places and they did not stop orlando let not all miss the mark all this and focus the wrong things the things that those social activist groups and warriors would like hijack this story and make about this about the threat that isis and their followers pose the west what should focused why did this happen who supported him had travelled the mena for training and what can done stop people like this from not only doing things like this again but also keep people who want things like this out the country all together letting the guilt riddled leftist agenda drivers steer this issue just about them and their special pet concerns will disservice not just the victims but the country whole ,1

 generally agree fan religious ideology any sense can hard have the conversation about problems with ideology without that creeping include people individuals general read that islam espouses some shitty things and shouldn act like that isn problem say the same thing when christin extremists bomb abortion clinics both have problematic language and views think the differentiating factor that islam codified the law islamic nations the beliefs are backed the force law most western christin majority nations the law mainly secular you can still get really poisonous messages about homosexually but the law punishes you for acting rather than protecting our directly participating think have fewer problems without the theocracy but nothing going stop guy who decided needs off bunch people finds repulsive and that brings arguments over gun control which while different thing but have large segments the public who won even have the discussion ,1

 not sure why you are resisting gst cause you say will butt fuck for years minimum prices will guess what 2016 yes 2019 namo phir bar bjp sarkar 2019 will have bear that brunt the only positive impact gst the end consumer that might have some indirect improvements via lesser bureaucracy fewer tax structures etc etc but that will certainly take much more than 2019 have any tangible impact bjp has already lost the gst war even gets approved today and implemented 2017 will hurt them 2019 whatever changes they might have done satisfy some the states requirements their karma hitting them back and that why ask not sure why you are resisting you should hoping get passed soon possible that modi has face that inflation 2019 ,1
 said before and say again gst only smoothen business machinery india will not the benefit consumers the cascading effect various state sales taxes the service tax and excise will subsumed into gst high rate that said there reason oppose less bureaucracy the end good thing the post gst regime there will requirement file only few returns deal with fewer tax officials which much better than the present situation where there separate commissioners and hierarchy for each the above taxes ,1

fat people cannot change their body type simply changing their diet that not how works also just eating lot doesn cause you get fatter one thing that will fairly reliably make your body retain more fat food insecurity your body learns that food isn always available and tries retain more fat case lean times which why many poor people are fat not obviously because poor people have access more more delicious food than rich people eating moderate meals indeed healthy practice but there absolutely reason you should assume from someone body shape whether they have this healthy practice eating moderate meals doesn reduce the body fat many people depending their genetics and illnesses and experiences and eating excessive meals doesn make many people larger even though does harm and intoxicate them ,1
