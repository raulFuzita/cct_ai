 family mormon have never tried explain them they still stare puzzled from time time like some kind strange creature nonetheless they have come admire for the patience calmness equanimity acceptance and compassion have developed all the things buddhism teaches ,1
buddhism has very much lot compatible with christianity especially considering that sin and suffering are almost the same thing suffering caused wanting things shouldn want going about getting things the wrong way christian this would mean wanting things that don coincide with god will and wanting things that coincide but without the aid jesus buddhism could also seen proof god all mighty will and omnipotence certainly christians are lucky have one such christ there side but what about everyone else well many christians believe god grace salvation and buddhism god way showing grace upon others would also help study the things jesus said and see how buddha has made similar claims such rich man getting into heaven joke basically advocating that should rid ourselves material possessions fact distinctly remembered jesus making someone cry because that someone asked what achieve salvation and jesus replied with live like buddhist very very roughly translated also point out that buddha rarely spoke anything about god theory personally because knew well enough leave that jesus and mohamed who came later just remember conflict difference opinion but education can fun involving and enlightening easier teach something than prove right like intelligent design ,1
seriously don say thing first all they won get its too complex explain normal people anyway and they are dogmatic then doesn matter what you say see mechante post and for any reason you decide later life move from buddhism and that doesn suit you identity though you still get keep all the wisdom then your family will treat you like you went through weird hippy phase for while there didncha and you never hear the end pro tip don put one these your wall jpg ,-1
what you have learned yours and only yours what you want teach different focus the goal not the wrapping paper buddhism can passed others without word about the buddha ,0
for your own benefit you may want read living buddha living christ thich nhat hanh you might find any subsequent discussions with your loved ones easier you are able articulate some the parallels that exist between buddhism and christianity don surprised they react negatively for having lost you treat them with compassion and deserved understanding although they may indeed display signs being hurt your new path properly sharing with them way that may alleviate their fear something they may perceive wrong the very least alien their beliefs may help allowing them the long run accept although not necessarily agree with your decision regardless where they end you have make your own way ,1
you should all sit down together and watch the simpsons episode where lisa becomes buddhist simpsons season episode she little faith then discuss ,-1
 was teens when discovered zen meditation was then undiagnosed bpd being homeschooled and just gotten 56k modem with web connection where came across link zen meditation tried for couple weeks and the change was palpable felt the most profound sense peace ever felt grades immediately started going had more energy started martial arts just huge positive change all around parents asked something was wrong fundie parents when anything changes this was where naivet√© kicked foolishly told them been trying meditation and really calmed down thought they happy that found something that helped but never forget what happened next mother affected this mockingly calm breathy voice she said you can pretend calm and happy all you want but without jesus you never content was that moment that any belief had christian faith all vanished completely realized that she had probably never been happy ever have never felt profoundly sorry for someone did for her that moment ,1

there are two varieties christians dogmatic that dwell words and conservative that take heart the spirit the teachings hate oversimplify things but helps this understanding you are discussing with dogmatic religious people who live the letter the law will uphill battle wish you luck you are discussing with moderates exchange idea should come fairly easily comparing contrasting also discussing parallel teachings presented differently wouldn out the ordinary they may give you relevant spiritual advice even though you are not believer their religion ,-1
dont worry about trying explain yourself just meditate regularly and try hard you can more aware everything else will follow coming from someone who has been throught his situation welcome pms ,1
 recently told family that buddhist live the bible belt this whole ordeal involved leaving the baptist church and everything been pretty rough but those who really care about have been open and accepting they seen the good has created life and relationships with others fact there are handful christians who have lovely conversations with and that truly respect someone else suggested living buddha living christ great one read about the important dialogue between buddhists and christians also welcome you message ,1
 unto others you would have them unto you would good start ,1
first understand that you are not anyway control how they will react always find that any subject better understood first learning the vocabulary explain what the word buddha means most people believe buddhists praise worship and follow guy named buddha christians due jesus let them know that one could both buddhist and christian with conflict the teachings and the messages jesus are indeed buddhist philosophy jesus became enlightened buddha and realized that had become annointed being christ then continue with your practice and let them work out their own issues that advice all the best ,1
 recently heard similar question where person asked they should introduce meditation his loved ones who had challenges coping with problems life the answer from the lama was quite interesting instead giving people advice one should focus his practice that way others will see the change and maybe even ask about personally think better keep yourself even though you must really excited about you can also keep dharma books around the house and sure people will pick them for quick browse when you are not looking learn bit about other people traditions well browsing through books they owned ,1
different times different cultures same point they were trying get across jesus said god has beginning nor end buddha said mind was never born and has never died just replace the word meditation with prayer and couting the breath with the name jesus and everyone happy,1

our campaign has two suns one pelor the other shamedan pelor the god all know and find bit stifling really shamedan the sun desert the burning sun who will kill you without mercy even second though shamedan brings drought and brings the fire that destroys all you own generally not very nice has race fey called desert hags who worship him and have radiant and fire resistance but they haven played nearly much part the campaign they should have ,1

 always liked vecna the one time was able use him story had blast playing the fact that was far not the most powerful deity but was one the most dangerous due his portfolio but favorite pale night who technically not deity but close enough guess most the abyssal lords and the rulers the nine hells are fairly straightforward and have ample backstory but her lack thereof just intriguing ,1
though don have any good suggestions for additional deities the moment you should probably have some overlap the cavern dwelling gnolls might consider pelor the god evil blinding them with his wicked light loki has sufficiently fooled them over the years into thinking their benefactor always leading them the bountiful crops they steal from the peasantry they have statues him fat woman giving out food the starving they view the god death the god justice giving righteous end those gnolls that have served brutal conflicts point view can change everything ,-1
 cliche but you can wrong with cyric mean was mortal who just nabbed all when got the chance you gotta respect that ,-1
zon kuthon and his sister shelyn good deity have really cool story from the pathfinder setting plus off topic pathfinder has the coolest good deity ever cayden cailean was bard that got wasted one night stumbled into the temple the star stone artifact that can turn you into deity and woke the next morning with hangover memory the night before and godly powers ,1
 homebrew setting the primary lawful evil deity named for friend lewie essentially has three domains tyranny law applied without mercy vengeance and community the idea being that cruel and harsh god but also recognizes that you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar thus his church often the most benevolent toward the common people day day basis the running gag that lewian churches sponsor more inner city basketball teams than any other major faith you probably want change the name but might make interesting dynamic within your setting ,-1

 far evil goes big fan shar from the forgotten realms setting the god ultimate despair loss and suffering you know god evil when followers don even bother asking for small boons but instead invoke suffering themselves and others hopes that those events will enough prevent the god from needing get involved personally bringing suffering into the world shar isn one those pansy goddesses evil where you might get nod appreciation for sacrifice with shar you better kill somebody damn near ever day and you get nothing and like with check out the dogma here ,-1
 like the idea prometheus giving magic the pcs however think that prometheus should more like demi god and that the reason why gives the magic mortals prometheus could jealous the fact that the gods have all the powers and they granted him only half status upon his creation thus his revenge giving humanity order turn the tides power among deities and mortals furthermore perhaps the repercussion prometheus feels from his action being dragged the underworld cerberus making him seem less than deity like and more mortal inhuman order face judgment from egyptian goddess morals virtue and judge the dead ,1

zen master bassui said when the functioning analytical consciousness destroyed feelings are purified this referred the pure land the west you truly want know the meaning being born the pure land you must first know the master who born this land the physical body has never from its inception been the true body but rather temporary formation the five aggregates after the four elements disperse what remains called the self the self originally empty what that born the pure land there master born the pure land what that seeks this land bliss just extinguish the ever seeking mind rid thoughts and attachment form and the body consisting the four elements will have individual self when there individual mind the nature mind and there aspect disorder ,1
pure land other power opposed the usual self power taught most buddhist schools though the pure land here and now and not some other dimension the afterlife ,1
there are many flavours buddhism pure land ideas are not common all them however the important thing realize doesn really matter that the big difference compared the abrahamic religions buddhism not dogmatic the sense bunch things that must taken literally else you are non believer sinner whatever maybe pure land ideas work for you great maybe they don great what works for you works for you what doesn work useless you the historical buddha himself taught dramatically different styles suit his audience parables and metaphors are just that the point where they take you not literally believing them literally and physically true zen koans are good example this very purely distilled most are the form stories but not stories you are believe physically happened you are reading history book that entirely irrelevant what the story does you that the point you are wondering did this really happen does this place really exist you are missing that point also worth noting that most things are about psychological phenomenon not physical phenomenon personally find this makes buddhist cosmology much easier understand than considering competitor physical cosmology they not conflict they just about different cosmos ,1
 going try comment this simply can gets metaphysical and some may even say supernatural but hope you can try maintain open mind enough for help with your understanding everything that physical everything that exists the universe and beyond are created the power the mind exercised through consciousness mara created the samsara worlds planes dimensions that may experience joy sadness love heartbreaks etc this was done through his her its focus the mind and streams consciousness began attracted these worlds planes dimensions and begin develop craving for existence and thus begins the cycle rebirth the pure lands buddhism were created the focus the mind amitabha buddha way help individuals attain enlightenment their own pace amitabha buddha understood that the attraction emotions sex love and existence can overwhelming for normal individuals overcome within one lifetime 100 years average for human beings other beings much shorter and yet others much longer created the pure lands the west place refuge and practice for those who call upon his name sincerely this place not metaphorical state mind while these individuals are earth for lack better word real though not necessarily physical the way feel physical things via the electromagnetic repelling force electrons this world certain laws physics are applicable that world land plane dimension whatchamacallit certain laws physics not apply and yet newer laws superphysics would also the rule there that not the law our world now having been carried this land doesn mean that the individuals are guaranteed enlightenment first they still need cultivate themselves while there enlightenment not given dependant every single individual consciousness efforts shed the fetters samsara anger ignorance and jealousy and embrace the noble truths they may choose rejoin the samsaric worlds again and back into the cycle rebirth but least they have the option stay and cultivate themselves the pure land the west that would the main difference between the abrahamic idea heaven against the amitabha buddha pure lands the west hope this helps ,1
 think your characterization pure land isn that far off there reason not that popular among westerners odd abandon christianity judaism and take pure land because first impressions buddhism was that was devoid dogma but now seems much leap faith the abrahamic religions least the pure land sect most forms buddhism have some sort supernatural element some orthodox believers might deny that just like some christians might attempt make scientific arguments for the world being 6000 years old the very least you have rebirth and different planes that includes devas zen seems have the least reverence for dogma which why popular the west the other western strategy assume things are meaningful figuratively and not literally but yeah buddhism religion the end the day for most its followers ,1
most religions have dogmatic orthodox well esoteric philosophic side the christian heaven can seen palace the clouds state mind rebirth buddhism can seen fact just superstition left over from other beliefs you interpret and understand you see fit like think about various religions talking about the same thing using different words and yes cherry pick what believe but honestly and very carefully think better than taking everything religion says and rejecting everything doesn say there must hundred different ways talk about enlightenment heaven pure land individuation alchemy rites passage education trials meditation the tricky part that what describes can easily explained words and most importantly has understood which different than just knowing reading about the pure land real place state mind doubt real place but sure some will believe buddhism has some dogma but not nearly much eastern religions ,1
you won find one answer your question but the pure land state mind perspective reality not separate place let quote thich nhat hanh human beings our deepest desire find environment which secure and where there love and understanding all want live such environment you live surroundings where you feel there security understanding and love and where people have the capacity transform their suffering fear and attachment then you live the pure land from finding our true home this isn leap faith all because you have already been the pure land but momentarily every time you bring the buddha mind fully then you are said the pure land imagine because you enter that state some degree this not matter faith but expanding upon what you know joyful experience quite different the abrahamic religions concept heaven which eschatological reality rather than gnostic one will add that there course are some who believe the pure land totally separate paradise however there are positive ways understanding this when the state mind another rebirth will seem like such foreign reality that may well different place entirely ,1
 first impressions buddhism was that was devoid dogma isn good thing about buddhism least for outsider that much easier pick and choose what parts you not want use see dogma kind environment habitat for the profound and useful ideas develop all religions have something useful buddhist religions and not just one homogeneous buddhism just seem have something that more relevant and powerful the context our culture ,1
from limited knowledge the pure land not paradise but place contemplation stepping off point where you are given the knowledge leave the cycle suffering and rebirth anything more akin the now defunct catholic idea purgatory than actual heaven ,1
 response your question about how amitabha created the pure land this quote from the article pure land buddhism wikipedia the longer sukhƒÅvatƒ´vy≈´ha s≈´tra the buddha begins describing his attendant ƒÅnanda past life the buddha amitƒÅbha states that past life amitƒÅbha was once king who renounced his kingdom and became bodhisattva monk named dharmƒÅkara dharma storehouse under the guidance the buddha loke≈õvararƒÅja world sovereign king innumerable buddha lands throughout the ten directions were revealed him after meditating for five eons bodhisattva then made great series vows save all sentient beings and through his great merit created the realm sukhƒÅvatƒ´ ultimate bliss this land sukhƒÅvatƒ´ would later come known the pure land chinese translation important remember that buddhism has been around for thousands years and that for long time buddhists didn have telescopes big machines scan the brain with his holiness the dalai lama himself has said that the discoveries science and the teachings buddhism contradict then the discoveries science are correct this video tgv1gwvrz one the major teachings the buddha was test out each his teachings oneself order see they were true rather than taking his word faith without proof however course just man who has seen mountain some remote region where one has not traveled may believed until the distance that region crossed might have some sort faith buddhist teachings since the people doing the teachings have often devoted their whole lives the teachings the buddha ,1

the discussion about the rat ended concluding won work because you will naturally headbutt the rat death minotaur might work with another race though trog wrath very very very difficult survive you have boots levitation and lots food you might able hover over lava deep water won help summons giant sized creatures other than that tomb card might work you have your stash food not sure you not using shield you might well switch two handed axe from experience anti magic isn that great with brand fire you can generally kill things faster use holy versus liches and other undead casters and also kill them faster ,1
 could swear they lowered trog wrath just got extremely lucky because recently tried make the switch kobe and was not difficult all just took food ring and some perma food and carved out two space area near the the summons were actually not the worst part the worst got was berserk hill giant and the vast majority were just berserk bears for the worst part was actually the rotting since happened least times and never caught right away while spamming rest,-1
for the love gods don the abyss until trog wrath over none your teleport blink panic buttons work lost handful very promising mibes this way ,1
 when and how supposed swap tso and branch order from there basically you switch immediately before entering crypt clear crypt max tso piety then holy brand your best weapon your case that executioners axe and off you post endgame branch order like whatever theres strict order like there the early game whichever branch you feel best prepared for how avoid meeting terrible fate the hands trog wrath you have book with blink soon you leave trog train transloc little bit that you can cast then whenever surrounds you with berserking enemies you can blink out the middle them and run staircase teleport you can keep scrolls blinking hand for this purpose but feel more secure also having the spell trog wrath includes fire miscasts that burn all your shit see trick with going lair and having rat block you off but this still viable you can the rat shield thing with most combos but its tedious and unnecessary and your case the minotaur retaliatory headbutt would kill the rat anyway its not option antimagic axe that carry around viable for use all since strictly one handed should train shields use with since have shield reflection could use not really war axes arent very good and while has fantastic selection resists does little damage that its not practical choice weapon against any tough monster wouldnt forgo the damage output weapon use physical shield shields arent very good for melee allruners and therse always tsos divine shield ability you want reflection isnt good shield brand plus its double not good for tso worshiper you reflect poison projectile and hits something you will incur penance for use poison ,1
 brother trog very wrathful indeed but his will destroy you neither endless nor inevitable going take the route many will find the easy way out and say that getting past trog your level trivial his wrath dangerous out the open but when you are able choose the area diluted mere timesink what you must grab your closest disintegration wand and cut two diagnols into the wall this will allow you only view one other tile time this point you simply need make sure you have good chunks permafood pip two and then either drop your scrolls wear conservation that point you just spam rest and then tab every time trog has tantrum minotaur your power should have trouble killing his summons after long while you will get message saying has calmed down then you are free worship that damned tso trog wrath your level probably one the least dangerous things you can spend your time dealing with you are willing cheese ,1
 were you slime zot except for the orb chamber and blade hopefully you find some better armour you really want good executioner axe before you convert well the okay but could better you really need wearing plate gda something heavier you have more than abandoned trog with level mibe and found pretty trivial the berserked stone giants weren terribly difficult and cleared tomb and most all hells while under trog wrath but somewhat wary trying this with your low and weak weapon you could try waiting out but takes thousands and thousands turns very boring one handed axes suck use executioner axe ,1
 have currently rune mibe right now and abandoned trog then immediately cleared crypt max piety and enchant executioner axe then threw caution the winds and cleared pan and hells while under trog wrath was tricky but doable make sure you have curing potions that time was strong enough take out trog summons all sides problem worked but could have died with worse luck ,1
 your stage you should strong enough take the berserk summons have the resources escape out them retreat corridor and take them one one quaff curing heal rot would also recommend you get plate armour better asap for the and guaranteed damage reduction also wield the biggest axes you can find kill things faster ,1
 you max armour dodging and shields for tso divine shield then the berserkers are joke can wipe them even when fully surrounded and only lose health even with armour and dodging they won give you much trouble ,-1
ewwww why are you using broad axe get real weapon bet trog gave you good battleaxe exec axe something splint get plate armour better trog wrath will completely destroy char with such poor defenses ,1

nonsense who claimed that the panacea for all evils will turn india into supapowaaa 2015 find one poster who claimed such here almost everyone acknowledges that the best atleast one the best amongst the current available lot and can provide governance that will atleast better relative the current upa regime ,1
yes won solve all the problems overnight but strong leader with plan still better than idiots with plan case study obama people expected the economy fixed the thursday after was elected and course that didn happen still fairly shit and most the issues that were big deal 2009 are still pertaining but still did manage eliminated subsidies private lender middlemen student loans and protect student borrowers healthcare reforms for tens millions americans expanded hate crime law the include sexual orientation appointed nations first chief technology officer signed financial reform law establishing consumer financial protection bureau signed financial reform law prohibiting banks from engaging proprietary trading are these irrelevant and pointless they aren hasn lifted america out the sewer but empowered students women consumers medical patients etc that they can achieve their potential without shit like insurance and loans get their way thus bringing back point the change you wantt see etc etc and that what believe modi can the change for the country must come from the grass roots easier said than done not like have deal with lapse enforement laws corruption red tape logistics etc you can call modi bots but think the alternatives double failure mms rahul gandhi digvijay chiddu what has the congress done besides spoonfeed the backward zombies and keep them backward ,-1
please change the title wretched country where its news sold appease the ruling party wretched country where terrorism sickularism maoism separatism tolerated wretched country whose leaders appease community the name religion and caste wretched country where its leaders are involved corruption scams rape money laundering tax evasion etc not saying namo will solve all problems but atleast will not remain mute and deaf like manmohan singh who does not even give interviews about his governance atleast namo speaks good bad about his state manmohan singh does not not even speak about the country just lapdog sonia gandhi ,1
and even more wretched the country that can depend even one man there have been people throughout history who were pivotal figures gandhi and lincoln are two examples have seen modi handle his charge that gujarat superbly contrast have seen politicians who are inept and corrupt led the congress which can sell out the country for example pitting against cbi and having suggestions surface that pakistan sponsored attack admitted pakistan was inside job yes bank the man hope nothing happens him because our opinion party that capable compromising india interests vis vis pakistan capable killing someone well ,1

 can remember when was the last time there was that much anticipation political rally huge crowd over lakh people stadium and every other one was was glued watch live telecast and didn disappoint never heard any speeches for more than say min but today watched the full 1hr speech and man imo was better than atal bihari first begins the speech with min telgu rhetoric which quite unique then doesn hesitate raise controversial issue and put things boldly like his support telangna pakistan issue vote bank politics food security chinese intrusion and targeted every congress nutjobs overall was well rounded attack and khangress for sure have hard time putup something even remotely defendable ,1

looking modi from outside seems similar popularity what obama was here when was running for elections both seem different from rest the field both attract huge number followers ideas both are fresh and both give people their countries hope that previous politicians had all but removed obama good president opinion but isnt good was saying will and that probably because political restraints under expect the same happen with modi seems have done lot good for gujarat but not sure can that level good for entire india both obama and modi are very eloquent orators ,1
 really have high hopes this man have never seen public demanding man made ,1
 jizzed hard just reading ,-1
 big fan either modi bjp but what says here what would want politicians say more often rather than saying things like any person gets angry after seeing injustice meted out family affected this then cannot held guilty bihar beti etc attempt appease any particular religion infuriates extent that people are ready castigate modi for innocuous somewhat misguided puppy analogy and then don acknowledge him when makes sense this the thing about really polarizing india people either love him immensely despise him completely very few people the middle ,1

modi the leader the indian neo nazi party bjp most the people who support him are skinheads who call for extermination muslims resorts appeasement neo nazis for more info about fuhrer here documentary about the modern day hitler modi and his policies c0zvadtrdpm also the ministers under him have been sentenced for inciting the riots like this woman and this guy ,1
 modi divisive figure people like call him you will get strong opinions from both sides and zero facts the same time the principle political opponent the nehru gandhi family with strong dynasty influence inc unifying figure where there global agreement that they are themselves highly corrupt and shelter the corrupt and the sole purpose they serve that indian national congress party would disintegrate the absence sycophancy some people strongly believe that having dumbass with zero track record experience governance much more preferable compared someone who may may not been responsible for sheltering the rioters each their own ,1
tell many people you can vote for modi this govt has destroyed the country economy there development there law and order most important all not able protect the country from muslim jihadis who are trying kill many possible ,1
lets say modi has attributes abcxyz people who like him like him for abcx people who don like him and despise him lot for cxyz that people who like him like him for different reasons than the reasons for which people hate him this why the whole confusion and cacophony opinions when person who trying understand the landscape modi has huge popularity among nris and india which don really understand why his abc characteristics for which liked much his supporters are his economic and growth policies and his pro hindutva ala pat robertson bill reilly style christian conservatism political stance his xyz characteristics for which hated much his opponents his association with gujarat riots during 2002 his state suffered through terrible riots between hindus and muslims triggered train full hindu pilgrims allegedly burned muslim mob resulted state wide backlash against muslims and about 1000 muslims died and many many more were displaced india has had his own share riots and usually the ruling leaders aren blamed much but narendra modi hated much because came television and sympathized with the hindu rioters addition there were reports him letting happen despite the controversy over the years modi has enjoyed widespread support his state and won many elections terms personality wise outspoken and has all the leaderish not leadership qualities indians desire their leader this year election could quite like 2012 american election where lot more people voted against mitt romney and republicans rather than voted for obama although congress government isn popular bjp runs with polarizing figure like modi then there will people flocking congress government but this does not predict the outcome the election hope that helps ,1
 been following reddit for while mainly because how entertaining and sometimes informative the comments various issues are been thinking joining for while and bit the bullet after seeing this thread what has modi done candidate what the gujarat story his many enemies will typically quote various statistics show his state poor light but the problem with statistics they can quoted out context reach the conclusion you want according your agenda gujarat means the most developed state india and does indeed lag behind many social indicators but the fact was doing far worse most these child malnutrition before modi became and speaking indicators rarely will your see article highlighting that gujarat contributes percent india industrial output and percent its exports gujarat has the lowest unemployment rate for indian state and accounts for percent new job creation gujarat has 100 percent rural electrification with power supply over 000 villages which has been boon not only for small scale industries but also farmers gujarat has agricultural sector growth percent against the national average percent gujarat known for great road network connecting the above 000 villages well well managed public transportation system gujarat known for relatively low corruption levels and higher efficiency police and government this has been helped governance and policing initiatives general getting things done much faster gujarat than the average for indian governments tata got its nano plant approved matter days rather than months years complaints about roads infrastructure etc are generally dealt with quickly there more but this should for start and typing out this much gleaned from various online and gujarati sources some reddit itself afraid already established myself moditard and will probably the immediate target all manner criticism ,1
truth told there not insignificant percentage the middle class who are willing vote for modi order avoid voting for congress corruption rahul gandhi but the modi tards are not making this easy decision should ,1

shortest answer that the ruling party the left side the political spectrum and has gone over the top appeasing poor people different religions and distributing free stuff modi leans the right and more free market kind guy and believes more the western sense secularism and wants uniform civil code one big blot his career which the opposition milking like desparados the 2002 riot during which happened the gujarat that another variable the equation ,1
 you come the wrong place ask about modi this place full ultra right wing hindu neonazis asking here about modi like asking westboro baptist church about religious tolerance you should probably read about him online from independent media sources ,1

 flick the switch towards modi thank the high decibel campaign the congress and stooges letting know all the things that modi did not sure which side the congress the media they seem campaign for modi and reminds cho ramaswamy could someone else too comment about the dmk loss the last election they gave out freebies like free and discounted cable connections lots people that very same thing boomeranged against the dmk showing the dmk corruption scam and other money grubbing activities the dmk larger audience with the free tvs and cable connections done the very tools that they were using bribe voters self goal ,1
not india such but conversations with north east friends who tell about the horrors congress rule refugees appeasement and that didn sit down well with regarding bjp was pro bjp during vajapayee but 2003 obviously helped shake that confidence only after years kind figured that there deeper game play looking the amount propoganda newspapers went voice their hate against modi wasn just right and yeah sickularism have had talk with folks who have problem with modi and they are entitled their opinion some the information they have which they use build their opinion selective and flawed but then some the information know might well flawed too everything war now are age information warfare more the information more tough shove away the and know the truth the human mind can only take much ,-1
" before used anti rss result anti bjp very skeptical towards aap thought jlp bill was silly drama used lean lot towards left but was not impressed their presence national stage thought other 3rd front parties are over ambitious clowns supported congress they appeared the best available option they are definitely not perfect but better than other options however must admit like most their purported aam admi initiatives you know the which will feed lazy people now still dislike rss vhp their ideology bjp fan boys their rabid bigotry scares don think modi evil too but very skeptical that would able control his masters fans sangha parviar cronies aap not bad very impressed how transparent they have kept their finances for that reason alone wish they will win elections delhi nothing has changed about left other 3rd front but then again you barely hear about them online anyway things seem would still with inc the best available option for the lok sabha

 tell people from gujarat people who been there what gujarat like just like any other good state india good urban centres and average poor rural areas are there broken roads there yes you people get clean drinking water and other facilities yes and people have access drinking water their premises according planning commission data 2011 clean drinking water treated drinking water like anywhere india completely like the usa terms infrastructure and civic amenities lol there still miles before you even remotely touch that level ,1
 been ahmedabad gandhinagar sometime 2005 and the roads there are high quality and they must the usual counter call this that capital city they take more care roads are automatically renewed etc live hyderabad and proof otherwise also like madhu kishwar wrote her manushi blog people have peaceful and safe social outing even after 10pm etc which relatively unthinkable hyderabad the cops themselves might give people washing and send home ,1
not much they would like you believe but still one the best states india live there are broken roads there still poverty lack clean drinking water issue the people are really friendly and nice fun state and the prohibition alcohol has done wonders the civic life have been gujarat for over years now and have loved every moment except for the fact that isn very accommodating meat lovers come and visit the state sometime the gir national park rann kutch especially during the rannmahotsav daman and diu somnath and many other places visit ,1

yeah dude its completely fab here pic jpg village gujarat more pics the news ece ,1
you will get comments from fanboys and haters neither them will objective search google read few articles compare indicators development with other states and then you will get the full picture ,1
from someone who has been gujarat while travelling various places some years back still remember the clean lane highways windmills everywhere the both sides the roads and the scenic beauty top that development total coherence with nature preservation was just small naive boy then though your dismay and mine those windmills and solar cell arrays are still hold rajasthan iirc the state things hopeless with the increasing thefts inox wind 150 crore the authorities don give fuck except looking for their cut and the private companies say they can install the machinery with these thefts going and its 2013 now compare that with gujarat also someone can confirm have heard from friends that any govt official doesn see your queries complaints within specific period time you can directly approach the modi its that simple try contacting mayawati ,1
yes has used live vastrapur which was considered lower middle class middle class area the vastrapur lake was developed front eyes changing the entire socio economic fabric that place within years also the will second rbecks visited friends village very small blink and you miss place near himmatnagar and the roads were lanes speaking people the village they told because the roads they could get their produce the cities themselves instead hiring 3rd party transporters have stayed many cities over life time delhi mumbai bangalore gujarat and comparing them all over one life time the changes are surprisingly drastic and saying that development happening all over india does not cut majority this development happening urban areas only but gujarat you can see happening both urban and rural areas,1
even germany progressed under hitler rule amidoingitright ,0
the clearly sarcastic and malignant posting this obviously very modest and holier than thou aap supporter ,1
 not all there reason why modi known feku popularly everywhere now doubt has done some good work gujarat but that only from more marketing perspective rather then any good value the people kankariya lake ahemdabad very well known face changed now completely looks like any international location but now common man cant there why because entry fee kankaria lake inr know inr not big deal but once lake which was open public now costing inr just enter highways and roads connecting village best but roads villages and cities are having tons holes industrialization has gone crazy there regulation come from kutch and have seen things really mad there terms pollution there proper guideline implemented terms what should height chimney mills chimney mills are low that when you even walk your home your feet will get black pollution villages are unbearable villages still runs most public transport not petrol diesel but fucking kerosene education definitely improving but you wont see much difference compared years consumption tobacco would highest gujarat gujarat govt corrupt like any other state govt company was bidding for project gujarat were told pay lacs for tender and tender will your favour but still cant give guarantee tomorrow someone else comes with better amount will ditch you your face narmada damn very good example modi doing good work really great work its benefits are tremendous but the way modi portraying progress gujarat just cream but ground reality worst then you can imagine ,1

 don count congress out yet they may form government delhi tomorrow will know how much social media impacts elections bjp didn had strong candidate delhi despite aap bjp gets majority will think that only because modi regardless that modi has very tough road ahead congress looses delhi and other states will see very nasty campaign 2014 would love see how muslim majority government employee majority and rich upper middle class area vote share and comparison with 2008 one gets majority who you think aap will support aap will take support from form government ,-1
well the guys below the original active participation politics started with development agenda modi and iac movement regarding this anti corruption middle class etc this aap party not the first india happened earlier during jayaprakash narayan era and his chela mulayam singh was arvind kejriwal that time the second time happened during singh era its simply matter time and enjoy how history repeats ,1
the very fact that the delhi elections are discussed india far more often than the elections the other states indicates that aap having great impact democracy india were not for aap vast majority would not care about these elections the major political parties india have always been cahoots and indian elections have had almost impact the lives most its citizens regardless how many seats aap wins hope all realize that this the first time grassroots organization built volunteers and without any kind corporate backing can have great impact indian elections ,1

what were the other policies you discussed not asking for details you gave above just bullet points thx ,-1
 thought would not understand policy discussions but what you have listed simple good way summarize increase oil production guess that should easy since saw recently that leaders all parties unanimously support this initiative for nominal amount really need this for inclusive development but guess this would need the support state governments too have really retarded regional parties ruling promising states congress has totally failed this aspect hope bjp could turn things around definitely agree especially are way behind electronics market many semiconductor companies have huge non manufacturing sites here iirc intel was supposed usher semiconductor manufacturing early 2005 and they pulled out because these lethargic policy makers not beat dead horse but wish bjp and all parties become serious tackling the silent corruption government especially the regulatory and enforcement boards like law and order environment water totally screwed one family members high ranking official one such board doesn matter which government has been transferred incessantly recently got transferred when got into tussle with opposition party mla industry and the ruling party minister summoned him next week and handed the transfer and top all not even honest does the least that could and that follows court orders god bless the honest officers hope this would change maybe the political discourse that happening among people nowadays will change ,1
nice know that thank you ,1
its because bjp wants such rules place and its better get done under congress they won get blamed that way ,1
" india has been ruined congress and populist schemes the problem with populist schemes that you can make noise you are opposition you instantly branded anti poor another problems once introduced not easy get rid them aap with share leftists and socialist like prashant bhushan yogendra yadav binayak sen etc are more towards congress ideology with added agenda anti corruption compared bjp want see some pro market reforms which will create jobs and get our country
back growth rate another problem have the minority appeasement meeting tauqueer raza and then going defend him aap doing the same things
that congress did third holier than thou attitude they just don accept that there are good non corrupt people all parties lot people from
congress and bjp joined aap and suddenly became non corrupt while they were corrupt their old parties don hate aap don like their ideology and attitude would even vote there was option aap like party with right leaning
economic ideology afaik loksatta one such party but even though stay hyd don have vote here have vote native state ",-1
long rant from aap supporter answers for all your questions you think that aap the only honest party and arvind some kind messiah arvind says that gadkari corrrupt that you will start running around with pitchforks and torches but ignore the news when gadkari proven innocent arvind says that bjp congress you aaptards being intellectually lazy will just accept gospel truth without asking why are raman singh jaitley shivraj vasundhra modi goa corrupt infact they are some the most honest intelligent and progress driven politicians india since very long time unlike aap bjp actually takes action against part members who act retarded case point jethmalani jaswant reddy kesubhai and many others compare that aap one founding members bhushan hardcore anti nationalist shazia caught accepting bribes even before election action against them defectors are given tickets arvind himself plays mulla appeasing policies numerous times aap just bunch idealist lefties who keep shouting the loudest that all politicians are thieves people being stupid accept the generalising statement and convert aaptards without checking the truth still don necessarily hate aap just think that bjp much better option also that most aap fanbois are just fanbois who can think thing themselves added later also point about aap fans being retards proven the downvote campaign which the resident aaptards downvote all comments after every such post proves point that aaptards are just bunch intellectually empty fanbois even the seems naive with his silly questions ,1
every question yours loaded how you expect objective discussion ,0
because aapturds eat poop then they poop and they use write false promises that why they are called aapturds,-1
did you adopt the karl rove strategy making questions that will give the responses you want parks and recreation reference for those trying figure out for the record don support any the parties mentioned here for indian politics has come choosing between the lesser evils ,0
 politics part the unholy duo religion politics which brings out some the most emotional and impassioned read holds barred slug flamewars the web expect people argue beyond region and logic ,1
 have said time and again most people arent shallow minded like the aaptards think vote single agendas agendas which they know unrealistic and just are plain rhetoric dont blame for not having the tunnel vision that you lot are afflicted with corruption does not mean effective governance rather live corrupt nation but one that provides relatively better governance than honest state that just stagnates you didnt understand what said the previous para that exactly the problem with aaptards and you need expand your political perspective ,1
aap the new congress congress issues certificates secularism aap issues honesty anybody who comes from any party and joins congress becomes insta secular similarly all the odd mlas who went from bjp cong aap because they were rejects their own party have become insta honest way just like cong the gangotri indian secularism aap the yamnotri honesty ,1
thanks for proving once again that aap supporters are bunch immature bholas having deep rooted casteist and communal views this why easy for congress make fools out you they split their opposition vote and made delhi ungovernable and you stupids fell for their game plan and still haven wisened hahahahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa troll ,1
problem with aap they are like worker union leaders sure they have honest intentions but then again not sure good union leaders would make good mds maybe wrong here but how much will ways aap survive reality still unknown even maharashtra prithviraj chavan was almost forced resign when exposed ajit pawars corruption even helpless what can you expect from others corruption like vicious network intertwined and ingrained into indian society should focus changing society unlike aap dudes who think bringing some law going improve things practically speaking bjp right choice about aap nothing can said how can perform national level ,1
all those who wonder why would prefer bjp over aap for them just for starters these policies link here ,0
 suspicious all politicians but simply cannot trust and accept anyone that has problems holding democracy hostage both and that hazare hack are guilty ,-1
thanks lot for the insight can easily relate point for example was never interested knowing something like katch but with superb promotion the gujrat tourism has certainly caught family attention and now features the visit locations for any idea how they would tackle the population increase problem india since may root cause many issues poverty level inflation essential commodity depleting forming land ,1
 don know what kind post you are reading rindia there are many many aap supporters here many posts aap supporters even mod aap supporter ,1
 good that has already started his policy hope gets one chance the top job about years yes policy decisions take time bear fruits upa1 actually enjoyed the benefits policies nda look upa2 see how they actually perform ,1
india also needs test the new nuke designs hope that pokhran gets test some newer and lighter mirv designs for our new missiles soon ,1
great appreciate your efforts and this healthy way debate and criticise opponents not the kind which involves baseless lies rumors and team foreign funding crap tired those now which for some reason bjp followers think more effectice don know who told them that because only pisses off and more damage than good bjp itself and since you mentioned your post and made clear our discussion that corruption the issue for will track this post and engage ina discussion once you address that point because matter what good policy you come with unless you can implement the ground they mean nothing and this why before anything want corruption addressed share with how modi planning fight corruption ,1
 hate aap for the other thread points such the routine flip plops appeasement ology positions stated about batla house etc this particularly because aap proclaims basic that others are not sum aap self advertised image and platform their commentary why they have not yet perform nothing about ,-1
 this will restrict migration this will definitely strike chord with mumbaikars hope they articulate this well the upcoming rally ,0
 not bjp supporter but love how modi core internet savvy supporters who claim modern are coming terms with the fact that their leader the only one who did not make any statement about 377 ,1

will the party support his vision ,0
 perhaps they fear they may lose small fraction voter base they either support oppose hopefully they will come with their views soon what think the problem that many individual party members may have personal opinion but they don want say anything against the party lines this just personal view party traditionally with right center views and the fact that they are mum about the supreme court having reverted the decision made the delhi high court fear they agree with but hope they take stance soon not having opinion all the worst stance for any political party especially issues relating human rights 377 homosexuality any other especially when party has strong candidate running for ,-1
 critical issue nice priorities bro for the record fully endorse the repealing the archaic law which needlessly protrudes into the bedrooms consenting adults but dont get carried away except tiny tiny minority urban centers one gives shit this issue ,-1
 the only problem will take years show its effects society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit ‚Äù the fact that the bjp manifesto which honestly could just bunch populist bullshit promotes long range initiatives reason itself optimistic about bjp led future years isn that long reality but the mind indian politician parliament election cycles ,1
 really have very little issue with bjp economic policies think they have the clearest agenda among big parties more concerned with the social aspects their agenda they also are doing terrible job the opposition and are known pretty corrupt ,-1
 like bjp should put this their manifestos anyway least the middle class and the business community will find attractive please continue you have more one suggestion read trade magazine some time ago about how employees maruti factory were striking for wages the tune whopping lakh illustrated how our labor laws had driven salaries unsustainably high many manufacturing sectors and stymied india efforts become manufacturing hub how even bangladesh was having more success than this regard fact this why many indian manufacturers seem hire disproportionately high percentage contract labourers work their factories they don have pay them the same high rates from this would say labor reform and reducing the power unions something else that needs considered the hidden policies that are wait ,1
 really hope focuses more rooftop solar ece like germany not just gujarat but the entire country much good skip hydrocarbon and straightaway adopt renewables that will have adopt anyways the future ,1
well who actually reads the manifesto ,0
why should bjp say anything there law has amended scrapped the government can introduce the new law parliament and depending the new law bjp can choose support not the problem posted the other thread day back most people are misunderstanding that the article 377 against homosexuals covers wide range issues and the foundation for other laws also makes lot heterosexual acts unlawful including general terms blowjob and anal sex you read and understand the entirety the law then you will understand that doesn mention homosexuals and applied against them should the law scrapped sure but before that see that since this the only law that covers sodomy guess india will also need laws covering rape male female another male also not sure the new rape laws 2013 protect male child not coz they not then this the only law per understanding which can use punish the criminal law not against homosexuals applied against them can applied against heterosexuals also scrap but create new laws first replace this law someone from the legal fraternity can ama and answer our questions about article 377 and rape abuse laws india will great clearing the misinformation ,1
politically would stupid move take stand right before the elections maybe that the reason,-1
 would like bjp come out support scrapping sec 377 but won expect them make comment this because there are lot religious organizations which are against scrapping 377 and support bjp there might loss support bjp takes stance this close national elections might not work well bjp does not have presence many states would not like alienate whatever support has other parts meenakshi lekhi pointed out her tweets this ruling doesn make any difference the act between consenting adults neither them will file fir police won come checking around your bedroom see what you are upto just that will illegal act eyes law congress the other hand has come support scrapping this law openly this spite asg arguing for the law guess congress knows won forming the next government any stand takes issues won hurt them much ,-1
the government should have say what goes between two consenting adults room period why the hell are you bothered about his stance lgbt rights just because that moron sanjay jha raised the issue ,-1
politics 101 country that medieval minded the one hand and seeks 21st century capitalistic interests the other ,-1
let put forward some problems and issues the first problem solved define sodomy and what acts are included presently blowjobs anal sex etc are illegal for everyone the major question arises whether allow fucking the assholes yes then should allowed just between homosexual interactions among heterosexual ones well lesbians having sex fine until they are not really penetrating anything you would wonder then how could called sex but they wish use sex toys for the same they are not allowed owning selling producing sex toys banned india sex toys are allowed india again the question arises should allowed just between homosexual interactions among heterosexual ones well even the act sex needs defined the present definition wont stand the point does not affect single law affects plenty laws commenting the issue would mean lot things and believe unless someone has clear idea what other effects that might have the existing laws she should refrain from commenting its good supporting opposing something but doing without knowledge inappropriate ,1
critical issue lol one cares ,1
this would issue these people were prosecuted under 377 and thrown jail tbn and9gctljwbsdyreogwxjxqaeakwn eauxr95fn6ylsdimxltrmsi3lh jpg jpg pride15 jpg agree that the article joke which also criminalizes heterosexual oral anal sex however practice person only charged one the individual not adult the act committed without consent yeah archaic law that needs but doesn harm anybody hence political party stance the issue irrelevant ,-1
good the focus creating platforms for wealth creation rather than distributing doles also more free the economy more less the corruption will hope bjp stays that way and does not bows the pressure the leftism atmosphere this country ,1

congress supporters not hate aap aap looks like better congress them bjp supporters are worried that straight contest between bjp and congress which they expected win easily has become possibly three cornered contest and the fence sitters non bjp voters angry cong have switched their loyalties aap instead bjp this not good thing their view and they will attack aap discourage these new supporters aap aap looks too impractical some and distraction they believe that replacing cong with bjp the practical answer ,1
everyone hates corruption stop being high minded about maybe just cynic but not hate aap just think they are naive and simplistic just elucidating against the problems with their solutions being untenable also not simple problem stop bucketing all there the harmful top down institutional which bad but the bottom corruption actually not bad here papaer pdf link pdf the relevant portion from abstract the whole paper interesting find that bad corruption corruption which asso ciated with poor institutions has negative effect gdp growth however residual corruption corruption which uncorrelated with other governance characteristics positively related gdp growth countries with poor institutions why this because have dual economy and bad institutions and cannot pay the lower level government officials enough and they cannot participate the black economy cannot and should not change that overnight fighting the political corruption sure should but not know any voter who for please get off your high horse not like any the parties india but there nothing more dangerous than high minded sanctimonious ideologues who sneer others change comes with the stronger institutions nothing aap proposes actually does that someone disagrees please point that policy ,-1
 why most you here india hate aap are you corrupt mind have you benefited through corruption you blindly support some other party you support some party because your caste religion brahmins bjp and muslims congress you don believe corruption can eradicated indian politics all these questions and you still ask why aap fans are the reason that people here have started hating that party anyone according you who doesn support aap all those keep your honesty with your self thanks another week with you guys and will really start hating aap ,-1

 reason that they complain too much they come with too much terms and conditions too many ifs and thens they dont analyze situation and have readymade answer removing corruption for every problem ,1
 hate aap let now answer your questions not really but when have deal corrupt minds myself turn into one not have enough time remain saint with corrupt minds and fight with them till they change would like work done they understand the language corrupt mind will become one not till now have logic behind supporting other party support namo and bjp have seen his work years have seen the result have seen the change have seen others appreciating his work including national and international governments basically everyone has verified some way that suitable take the national further through development name one single leader entire india who has got much appreciation through both national and international governments him the first ranker politics right now supporting him support bjp because want progress and development there other party india that has much clear vision bjp and namo does corruption can eradicated politics not something experimented aap the only party that focuses only corruption nothing else but their agenda ideology has real base real proof what they say true and can done then they should become part government delhi and provide sample and ways right now they not know how nor have they tried before nor they want become part government hope this answers ,-1
from another thread want ask how can someone who will purportedly run clean political party start his career with lies committing character assassinations honest people and not apologizing when the accusations not amount anything then there the matter persistent muslim appeasement style politics claiming batla house encounter was fake then when people tried pin him down doing volte face and saying that agreed with the court judgement the point note that the judgement had been out for months when the offending aap pamphlet came out approaching the muslim electorate not citizens but flock who can pimped out sundry maulanas like taqeer raza taqeer raza has been indicted for giving out fatwa behead tasleema nasreen yet when asked kejri brazened out saying let someone produce proof that taqeer raza issued fatwa when there are cases against him running courts for this very thing also the volte faces are far too frequent some gent writing for indian exponent criticized economic vision document aap website link below today that document gone from aap website there stand that aap will not give will not play well the mediia what can trust them for aam aadmi party aap economic vision been disappointment far html then there are previous baseless allegations aap went town claiming that bjp candidates have criminal cases against them when the reality that almost all cases are for crimes like unlawful assembly these are the exact kind cases that kejriwal and many aap candidates themselves are facing given that bjp was the principal opposition the capital for the past years its natural that most such cases for public protests will against the bjp candidates how can you trust the allegations coming out his mouth when willing indulge such cheap tactics please dont think that saying these things bjp supporter was vocal supporter the iac movement going the extent taking half day leave and joining protest the now feel cheated that kejriwal has used the support well meaning people like launch himself career active politics which neither intellectually nor ethically equipped handle any case not trying tell you whom support but former iac supporter want say that dont find aap politics any different from any other political party ,1
 you have provided options aap haters per your tiny winy kuchhi pucchi chhotu motu understanding indian politics with all due respect may ask for provision nota ,-1
" like aap for its stand corruption and making people aware about their civic duties and mobilizing youth take part active politics hate aap for its communist ideology public appeasement policies minority appeasement which are not very different from congress and for its arrogant and holier than thou attitude
they have build party showing negative points others its high time they show good governance forming government delhi and prove themselves fulfilling tall claims they have made ",-1
 are you corrupt mind have you benefited through corruption you blindly support some other party think this illustrates why people hate the followers aap with vengeance much fucking smug stupid that they can power thousand suns which have died down and turned into barren stars edit also this thread posted nri muslim nri muslim lethal combo ,-1
and let not forget most the aap are kinda naive believing that once these folks get power their problems will fixed the shitty truth won and can the way they would want edit but respect them for shaking things ,1
 why you hate other parties apart from aap how does khujli dick taste are you corrupt mind have you benefited through corruption you blindly support some other party you support some party because your caste religion brahmins bjp and muslims congress you don believe corruption can eradicated indian politics ,-1
your questions are absolutely ridiculous and shows how out touch with reality you are the world not all black and white just because someone votes for support particular party doesn mean they hate the others definitely don hate aap don like their solutions problems and don care for their style politics don see how anyone can logically expect adding more bureaucracy lokpal solve the problem corruption that was created too much bureaucracy begin with similarly their election promises free water and cheap electricity everyone what one the richest cities the country backward step when should moving away from govt subsidies for everyone all means support the poorest the poor with all the subsidies the world but there reason why the govt should lose money powering the air conditioned bungalows the super rich delhi the poor barely have any electric appliances this country the only way they are going able pay for such subsidies increasing tax revenues which will primarily impact businesses negatively and the domino effect will affect job creation etc aap anti capitalist tilt pretty evident anyone who isn totally blinded their anti corruption talk just because they claim have good moral stand corruption doesn mean should blindly trust them with all aspects governance clearly lot people delhi not agree with and that perfectly fine they are entitled their opinions and choices just like entitled mine ,1
 many assumptions man just many least try possible neutral and unbiased you going for discussion ,1
 dont hate aap but your questions are example why disagree with their style politics your mind people who disagree with aap hate aap they are blind supporters some other party are corrupt caste ist there room for disagreement with aap and still honest upright citizen who wants good things for his country this extremism one the reasons why dislike the aap ,-1
 always hated self righteous morons ,-1
what hate about aaptards they mentally convinced themself that kejriwal the only option any other argument met with vehement resistance anti corruption rhetoric and personal attacks both myself and the party person defend can abide naked hypocrites self denial people who like hide from things they don want see and hear the last couple days heard kejriturd compare atal behari vajpayee scamohan singh also heard response modi honesty sound economic policies consisting nothing but anti corruption rhetoric the age old 2002 riots propaganda simply absolute silence and finally complete lack awareness interest the political realities scenarios aside from bjp congress bhai bhai lokpal swaraj kejriwal will save some deeply flawed and full holes way ,-1
 aap supporter but stop this with against bullshit ,0
why can disagree with aap policies without agreeing the reasons you have provided this ploy many who wants label somebody anti something for example you don temples you athiest you not hindu etc etc the simplest all reasons that self righteousness and pragmatism cannot mixed sometimes you will have take decisions that are unpopular against well established principles keeping mind future benefit and common good you cannot flexible such situations you are not doing any good administrator politician ,1
 bakchodi leaking again ,0
 corruption just matter legality financial irregularity and bribery the currency social transaction egregiously unequal society which power continues concentrated the hands smaller and smaller minority imagine for example city shopping malls whose streets hawking has been banned hawker pays the local beat cop and the man from the municipality small bribe break the law and sell her wares those who cannot afford the prices the malls that such terrible thing future will she have pay the lokpal representative too does the solution the problems faced ordinary people lie addressing the structural inequality creating yet another power structure that people will have defer you and your chutiyaapa,-1
 hate the aap because has absolutely real plans about improving the country situation corruption can only agenda for long there are problems this country more important and more destructive than corruption and the aap instead focusing them actually tries fuel those fires what will they when there some actual work done their delhi manifesto only shows promises they can hope meet irrelevant feel good policies that absolutely nothing for the country and the jan lokpal bill defeating corruption doesn automatically fix all the problems our country just like adding doesn result also disagree with the method they use defeat corruption they completely sideline development which instrumental and perhaps the only way about reducing corruption and instead focus doling out freebies limiting their exposure lower rung corruption and blaming other parties their daft policies are second reason not support them free electricity lower classes and reduction its price fixing vegetable prices have you learned nothing from the congress mistakes basic economics laal batti what the point that again your mlas will the only ones reach parliament half hour after assembly commences half salary for ministers this isn corruption bait the aap hasn single policy that makes iota sense the self righteousness displayed kejriwal and his goons worse than the emotional outbursts modi supporters the internet just watch any debate and cringe kumar vishwas yogender yadav throw unsubstantiated statements well accusations the bjp don care about the congress not going there they act though fighting against corruption the only reason for man descent from trees and thus are quick name the bjp and congress being the same without shred reason related either the stark differences their style governance the prosperity the states they govern and the level contentment within the people those states the fact that arvind kejriwal himself hasn proven his administrative skills and isn likely considering the fact that they hesitant about creating government delhi you know that thing they stood the elections dismissed them easily they dismiss the notion having agendas besides corruption ,1

 just small party with noble goals their ideology seems bit muddled and bit too idealistic lots parties start out like this lot things their initial manifesto seemed very poorly thought out maybe that has changed but ultimately just like every other election there will mostly hung parliament and leadership will decided horse trading with shifty state level parties mamata jayalalitha mulayam singh cpm karunanidhi etc etc this one the things that holds progress back frankly whether bjp aap bjp power the country will the shitter really wonder how people think otherwise just look the last years after independance people really think regime change has huge effect anything for example home state west bengal had regime change the party tmc came power with huge promises barely see any difference honest think both the cpm and tmc are awful when power changes hands move from set thugs another not really strongly pro any party highly doubt any party will easily fix corruption india generally very jingoistic very young and strongly influenced peer groups facebook twitter media lot people here are right leaning and pro hinduism very small community and not really the kind place where you will find ton debate topics like this will generally very polarized generally don discuss politics with people since just reflection their adherence group think ,1

this very good stuff thank you for taking the time post here all the points you raised and the discussion points this thread have with government investment know this necessary but not the full picture there needs very strong emphasis removing excessive laws and regulation take your point raising revenues for the government you have listed five but there unthinkably large number activities people could only starting and running businesses didn involve interacting government officials second third tier towns the government can just provide basic services roads water internet millions small business owners could relocate out choked cities and spur local growth the opportunities are endless consider the city mysore under the classification the five would pretty much fall squarely under tourism but the government could give better power more reliable communications and better roads bangalore could very easily transformed into hub the revenues that come out the ecosystem will far exceed any the original five categories ,1
 see aap followers are conspicuous their abscence here the ideas seen here make you uncomfortable don want reminded kerjiwal non existent plans for economic revival and repairing the damage wrought the upa don like hearing good solutions that the aap can provide ,1
 this because import our oil needs and produce just and trade deficit makes matters worse depreciates the value rupee yeah only partly what about the indian oil prospecting companies that are allowed sell indian drilled oil indians international rates there are huge profit margins the wells reliance and vedanta this national resource that few people are being allowed profit from ,-1
exactly the reason don want aap ruin bjp chances supported aap only for delhi elections but now seems like they are driving confidence without proving how effective they are delhi bjp might have many corrupt politicians but overall has been more development pro than any other political party india can all write letter aap requesting them run delhi efficiently for years instead focussing this time ,1

for political party coming out nowhere not totally true but look their competition and completing their first anniversary only recently even they win seat will huge win for indians like who hope for better india who left better career prospects abroad stay india and something about the state affairs here the india which gandhi and patel and maulana and nehru and ambedkar and prasad and lalaji and gokhale and many others dreamt which kalam dreams which every citizen dreams the meantime you can cry some more ,1
 seems that they are taking congress too html vishwas believed keen fighting from rahul gandhi constituency amethi had earlier said have applied for lok sabha ticket from amethi and the committee will decide this html robert vadra issue there because involves famous person the fact everything like this happens everyday haryana certificate change land usage happens everyday one the well known analyst haryana chaudhary said that don have corruption haryana brazen loot course will make issue think aap extremely positive development for india they certainly have shifted the center gravity indian politics the cleaner side ,1
aap going eat away the congress and the regional parties vote much more than the bjp vote per the last known internal calculations aap expected get around seats while the bjp would still around 200 the biggest perceived advantage aap that they would contain the gandhis and the top congress leadership the seats being fought gandhis any loss there even significant decrease victory margin would huge egg the face situation ,1
aap has divided youth voters they are not dividing caste religion most the immature fanatics are young people who haven seen 1990 ,1
hahahaha aap supporter but boy love the fact they have made bjp and moditards run shit scared like headless chickens think the country owe big thanks arvind kejriwal just for making moditards realise they have not won the elections already ,1
lets steps want congress free india corruption free india ans corruption free does bjp has image being corruption free and would make india corruption free ans there party that gives that hope ans yes there are aap loksatta which are mostly going come together how can bjp fight ans definitely not lame arguments the team but beating aap their own game become more accountable the people rti transparent disclose funding sources remove criminals field better candidates and not the likes bokhariya radadiya yeddurappa until bjp ready compromise with its election strategy based our demands see reason whatsoever compromise with demands and vote for bjp this the only way fight aap not incessant wailing splitting hair and definitely not ridiculous fear mongering ,1
 there chance for the aap win any kind majority the 2014 lok sabha elections nor will any other political configuration have entered the world post election coalition parties you are making the assumption that congress gone that the third front will bad would not count either those technically would stupid for aap not try test waters let see how the results come out also please understand that not everything about bjp modi please try remember that when you examine what aap does ,-1
aare you referring that aap should not contest just because would cause political unstablitiy shud india declared state for the dynasty politics bjp and congress would against religion kill dont make take arms not stopping you make stupid comments reddit and raising confusing topic have vote and would happily give aap matter what politics equation means end doesnt justify means,-1

arvind kejriwal thousand times better than congress opposition will make sure that bjp does not become another congress aap only helping achieve the target congress mukt bharat should welcome aap entry the scene although not supportive unfair amount media attention being given them ,1
false dichotomy either you are for for bjp you are out destroy the nation whoever has heard opposition that does their job properly and keeps the ruling party line ,-1
eli5 why does everyone else has nothing speak against namo except the riots mean has only one catch not juding him innocent guilty ,-1
man even though support aap would like bjp come power with absolute majority just because lot people strongly feel that they are the need the hour and bjp not make people lives better both economically and socially hope their supporters would criticize them enough make them change seek alternatives other than congress and bjp they perform well and good for everyone ,1
great post hope bjp supporters will explain their points and arguments against the aap succinctly systematically and without vitriol and aap supporters will forego their usual self righteousness and listen ,1
first all kudos you for summarizing some very thoughtful points against aap such articles are rare come this subreddit where most the political discussions end descending karma grabbing mud slinging matches and deserves more upvotes have your questions except for their infinite faith and ability simply presume good what the aap supporters base their support believe that the most the supporters have put their faith the past record activism one man arvind kejriwal which pretty much synonymous the case bjp main man narendra modi both their records are out the open for everyone see and fair kejriwal has been tireless social worker even before the whole anna thing blew guess both bjp and aap supporters need asking this question what happens when the sole leader doesn live the promises you vote for person ideology system how ensure that everyone sticks that ideology system modi fan myself but find very difficult answer that well the long run what can aap give that the congress didn and couldn only time will tell that one but most people are hoping for corruption free government lets see how far they take delhi the power collective good intentions the water and power policies not seem panning out how earth aap different from congress under the sun today same old minority appeasement same old subsidy tricks same old attacks narendra modi seems like aap the mirror image congress only under different guise you got there other than few fresh faces the same old system compromises over accountability hoping proven wrong they are freaking corrupt why the heck are aapians not putting them jail instead taking their help this what want understand give this one aap for they didn back down play the dirty game the situation demanded but there was good chance that bjp might have swept more seats there was election also their conditions stunt was just childish nonsense ,1
 short ideologically aap congress corruption bjp supporters needlessly worry about losing votes congress who should scared because their voters will gravitate towards aap what aap offering socialism which does appeal large section indians bjp more free market and has the baggage rss ,1
 find the question loaded bjp the standards which you need evaluate parties hint bjp not that awesome variety options better for functioning democracy left centrist party with baggage always welcome your points only bit worrying rest are just array silly exaggeration wrong assumption misrepresentations facts sure aap has its foibles but they are fresh kids with much less bad things than other parties come give them time prove their worth bit early write them off ,1
aap moving towards communist idea decentralization and putting things and people where they belong cpi and aap have both agreed this bjp and congress say something and something else point discussing ,0
 long they dont all right wing nuts and don have support from the likes kamdev and assaaram which the bjp has with aap ,1
 this the reason d84nwor r3a have started discussion elaborating apprehensions about aap hate aap because aap acting proxy for congress their jihad against narendra modi ,-1
 bjp has iconic and celebrated stalwarts like subramanian swamy clearly scholar learned person gentleman whose opinions should mull over analyze and imbibe with immediate effect ,1
long story short most indian voters are not really knowledgeable enough think too deeply about such things they support the aap mainly because the promise new messianic figure kinda like modi without any the baggage existing political parties ,1
bjp offering modi aap can offer anything worse than that tried ,-1
all those questioning aap taking support congress different people have different views his you asking why did take support congress others say should take congress support form government and show what can deliver the country now please you tell who should listen who would you have listened had you been his shoes the choice not simple but has listened his heart that what any sensible person his position would have done yes might succeed his commitments might fail but then the people are watching him closely should not atleast give him chance prove himself only been few days now and has stirred the political class with his stern decisions did bses ever dreamed that they will audited just within days becoming delhi can you already see the fears political class and corrupt the decisions and steps aap taking noone one amongst just like the friend you have who you roam around with everyday not vip just common man but his actions are not common all ,-1
 skulduggery aap made lofty impragmatic and somewhat unattainable promises but didn‚Äô get into cumbersome details they kept deliberately vague how these promises would kept please read the manifestos the promises are nowhere tall the ones made modi for example the aap spuriously promised give 700 litres free water the poor and according media reports they delivered all good then right but they did not deliver they only gave metered houses not the poorest people the slums who actually are the need that water this actually gives incentive the people delhi get metered installed besides although subsidized should not free there will lack motivation save seems unrestricted even only certain level average consumption middle class family more less 700l the limit acts encouraging factor conserve since can relieve them the bill opposition nuclear energy honestly totally disagree with this move however still need wait for official statement the issue because the reason why aap protested against the kundankulam was due their perception lack safety measures their flawed economic model the biggest problem they are yet release clear well defined description their economic policies and models but this should give sense what their stand ,1
man you should write article for paper honestly ,1
 aap grows large enough will split into various factions like the janata party did each these factions will handle the different criticisms one will hindu aam aadmi party another will pro nuclear aam aadmi party yet another will free market aam aadmi party ,1
the bjp you claim more free market but don think opposition fdi retail they might have their reasons those reasons might justified but still not free market economics questioned modi tendency towards free market economics when his government banned gutkha not spitting and public littering but gutkha while leaving the ban alcohol intact not elegant enforcement penalties domestic violence public misbehavior but easy brute force ban alcohol the ban gutkha caused drop areca nut prices don know about gujarat specifically but speaking couple farmers karnataka where the congress govt banned gutkha understood there was drop about prices much for free market economics this concern regarding anti laissez faire was accentuated bjp leaning towards preserving culture the recent official declaration their homophobia was just example one would want question the sanity the thought processes the upper rungs the bjp the congress too hasn shied away from culture preserving stances example the statements made the mangalore mayor condemning resort culture following the attack group reveling teenagers resort you asked what the aap will differently from the congress the aap was among the first political parties come out against section 377 the ipc that criminalizes anal and oral sex the bjp was among the first support forthrightly and directly criticize homosexuality western disease the congress came out against section 377 but seems more like move salvage some support when elections are around the corner despite having been power since the 2009 statement issued the delhi high court the congress motives here are questionable they also going after the power generation companies delhi irregularities are found expect lot high ranking politicians will incriminated this one more item that the aap will differently from the congress the aap seems delivering election promises however vague words have been followed actions unlike the congress you might consider not delivering water unmetered customers bad thing but this certainly encourages all customers install metered connections further consider such policies socialist something against given voluntarist leanings but this still better than crony capitalism where land offered throw away prices corporates such practices are the beginning the rise monopolies monopolies are irreversible without socialist revolutionary intervention between the aap and the bjp still undecided whom would vote for but the bjp doesn have that great case against the aap you make out while the aap might have displayed socialist tendencies the modi government hasn exactly displayed laissez faire the bjp whole not sure about given their spectacular failure karnataka you might worship subramanian swamy but think nut job you might say nationalism but say self righteousness and the bjp and their conservative culture touting support base has lot would much rather spend government money subsidies than statue not that proponent the former ,1

this not community some 200ish people who happen from india isnt this india where the topics discussion should about india and not about some frequent india visitors for any personal rebuttals name calling etc etc cant use instead its shame see the top post india bitch fight like this please correct wrong ,1
those that ran that sub were carrying out suspicious activity basically downvoting every comment that was against the bjp then downvoting any thread that had anything against the bjp was pretty sure that activity since when the downvotes would come they arrive huge numbers since was private sub many couldn see the activity that was happening there fuckers got jolt ,1

the plot thickens ,0
 dont get one thing the subreddit concept can greatly used for containment like circlejerk namoarmy wants furiously masturbate and upvote namoarmy what the problem still didnt understand how the ban and your description related because they were influencing upvotes other subs ,1
isn there mod setting whereby new users account age day old week old even month and users with low comment karma lets say 1000 both metrics for india are prohibited and limited comments per hour time frame the sub this won affect users with account age older than year and comment karma low hundreds seen few these users and they are mostly nice and only engage posts which are off beat these guys are lurkers anyway doesn affect them most them won reading the recent useless drama here anyway this account age restriction can extended even year strat ever perfect but one major benefit this would the incentive just act like tool without fear getting banned would less because the cost just creating new account and engaging more right away will increase dramatically there incentive build repo and since time and effort will have been spent user build that account she will act better more cases than currently the case said strategy perfect but its about managing the chaos one should learn useful aspects from the best the chinese censorship apparatus they don ban most things outright that never works instead their most common approach make the user experience hell and shitty possible why would someone use facebook some other site service every minutes the connection timing out slow and what not the incentive use longer there those who will persist their numbers will fall rapidly and very low and the goal achieved mods should work this direction they can not ban everyone and shut shop they need make the situation for idiots not worth their while spent all this time spreading here ,1

sorry know this isn what you asked just venting frustration here aap has thrown everything off but they keep this nationalisation anti fdi reservation increased quotas referendums for everything hopefully they won get many votes watching ndtv now listening rabbi shergill singer aap talk about how growth bad that mnc are evil american corporations delhi gov freakin reversed the decision fdi that previous government took after years deliberation less than month this action alone will raise red flags the investment community there respect for continuity their actions will back wearing langotis and burning cow dung aap comes power wholeheartedly thank congress for supporting aap delhi because quite clear they are leftist radicals waiting cut off india from the rest the world expected good governance anti corruption yet see any major person tried let alone jail ,-1

 really wonder the logical dissonance this post modi may very well think this but point out one example such thinking leading the exploitation the valmikis gujarat under his administration long his policies aren affected such views which may add were put forward seven years ago there reason criticise his leadership here edit downvotes why ,1
even though not practicing christian christian born and indian citizen this frightens thought modi was different bjp leader pushing national unity and all sad ,-1
actually bangladeshi hindus should accommodated india for the very reason muslims are part this country much hindus when india was partitioned two nations were formed india and pakistan while india chose remain secular nation giving equal rights all least theory pakistan chose become islamic nation where hindus not have the same right muslims india has accommodate all muslims who wish part this country because founders our nations decided this people may grudge this decision but have accept and fulfill this promise pakistan the other hand doesn have accommodate them and doesn try much fact that hindus bangladesh are suffering because religious persecution also fact that muslims bangladesh are not suffering due religious persecution first rule anyone illegally coming from bangladesh india must deported but humanitarian causes take precedence and based that hindus should accommodated india know that many hindus their hate for modi are willing forsake hindus bangladesh little more understanding the situation required bangladesh was same india then hindus and muslims bangladesh would equal people are overlooking the fact that hindus and muslims are not equal bangladesh hindus and muslims are equal only india and hence this contradiction use pakistan and bangladesh interchangeably for obvious reason not talking politics here anyone disagrees please debate not get your political agenda here ,1
 bigotry thought you were gone with roch but how missed you how would india india without your daily dose muslim bashing bigotry ,0
 source will have accommodate hindus from bangladesh modi 1403963 html modi have responsibility toward hindus who are harassed and suffer other countries where will they india the only place for them ,-1
apart from tweets couldn find any source him having said this leaving that aside don think any bangladeshi should allowed till sort out our own problems also though things should equal there are few grey areas though there might illegal immigrants from both religions which should strictly discouraged hindu immigrants might also victims ethnic cleansing which case they would and should have higher priority ,1
how anyone going verify the border who muslim and who hindu refugees could from either religion welcoming one set should welcome the other for those wanking over modi saying india the only place for hindus hindus can nepal bhutan any other country asia too india not hindu country secular country ,1
well what surprising what else one expects from bigot like narendra modi ,1

tragedy india the rulers come from italy and the voters from bangladesh jai ,0

dat self righteous smug face lol first bangladeshi hindus are merely refugees but majority bangladeshi muslims are illegal immigrants and second what the most pita about bangladeshi muslims their sectarian and staunch anti national behaviour which causing huge disturbance most region ,1
 think that hindus both bangladesh and pakistan should given shelter india political asylum considering the international norms providing refugee politically abused and threatened people note that modi had said indian muslims are not indians that would not have been acceptable however giving refugee and integrating religious minorities from neighboring countries seems the right thing religious majorities those countries however need use legal modes immigration they wish rather than just cross over the border squat more resources ,1

 lokpal will clear corruption out india and even greater out indians highly unlikely corruption not crime but disease and remedy development education discipline change attitude laws and rules were enough change country years there would dowry khaps murders untouchability school donations india there would cocaine almost riots gujarat for straight years not because strict law against riots but because shift focus from religions roads and buildings administration and development lokpal aap what ram mandir bjp what poverty congress what reservation mayawati and mulayam,1
aap does not have the numbers get majority best you can hope for that the third fourth front get then they beg for aap support get who would then extract lokpal bill the cost for support ,1
 feel its herd mentality you see media and your friends criticizing and decide aap must bad uncool support anything they well how many have seen speech and read good news about him not many they don even read about and start calling him dramebaz surprised that people who oppose aap are against everything they well think has become ego issue many the people ,1
 the first place aap having real idea solution for any issue besides corruption big hit them the second place they don even have real solution corruption lokpal farce exaggerated dream all does add yet another layer investigative bureaucracy over the acbs cbi intelligence agencies cag vigilance commission and judiciary with them involved investigations will take even more time now but whether corruption will punished different matter and till date have yet hear answer for the very simple point what the lokpal members are themselves corrupt corruption has seeped even into the independent judiciary then why what use independent lokpal that leaves with reason vote for the aap this year beyond being disgusted and wanting spite the other parties which describes the majority their fans ,-1
 much the chaddiwalas out here india and facebook shiver their panties aap does not have the number gain majority and form the government modi going but aap could possibly form the opposition party and that could keep nda its toes ensure does not indulge too much corruption ,1
 you mean say vote for aap pass bill assuming very strong bill and let the country debt the vague notions arvind kejriwal water subsidy kejriwal new all these its like you are making engineering graduate the ceo multi million dollar company its likely going fall and guess what any chance any kejriwal proposed plans not work again going resign the bill can not throw corruption out this country all highly unlikely that even going happen another hand modi will develop the country infrastructure wise may look into matters like improvement rural areas problems electricity and water shortage etc arvind kejriwal just like small kid planning for summer the kid will have huge plans won realize the hurdles ,1

why this being downvoted you might ask both mochi and ansari were critical modi and his development model where development gujarat any talk development just sham still live footpath lal darwaza still single can afford get married because financial status said mochi ansari said modi posing with muslim leaders trying cultivate the impression that the community now with him the truth that the bjp has done nothing for muslims people living other states should know this truth that the reason have come with the book said ansari ,-1
both unmarried but jaya goot more saries,1
 thought had huge power problem and industry was going out because anyways amma came back think 2011 only before that was dmk power there while modi has been office since 2001 against earthquake which destroyed gujarat and redeveloped state from ,1

 don know much modi but far jayalalitha concerned she takes very few inputs from any section most the decisions are taken her within inner circles which imo she could have broader consultation would very good she has stern mind take bold decisions ,1
how this pro amma says has higher revenue much much higher excise revenue but same fiscal deficit the extra money going amma pocket ,1
 not modi fan but think ridiculous compare development metrics two very diverse states very simplistic way look the problem ,-1
not fair comparison amma has hardly been power while modi his 3rd term amma previous track record not good she was voted the worst was worst governed state don remember back when she was power the 90s she seems have big aspirations read and has the potential deliver here hoping she turned over new leaf and doesn fuck things ,-1
this infographic only shows you how developed itself but doesn say anything about what amma herself did this honestly useless you are comparing modi and amma ,-1
seriously did you infographic maker even consider the fact that alcohol tax revenues are significant contributor the treasury top off sells almost all its alcohol from tasmac designated government liquor stores and has rule that only alcohol made can sold imfl this random edit really downvotes this why stopped posting india and even deleted account previously really irritating really says lot about the quality person who lurks here you can post decent rebuttal atleast have the sense refrain from discussion lazy press the button disrespectful the community one gives rat ass about reddiquette damn disappointing guys damn disappointing ,-1
 having less per capita consumption good thing could argue that less consumption due poor connectivity load shedding ,-1
absolute development levels are meaningless development growth rates are what matters you have big head start you are bound ahead absolute terms even your growth near zero learn2math,1
this infographic sucks donkey balls why you compare excise revenue when gujarat dry state and massive lol the power comparison others have said its much better comparison between states terms growth percentage ,1
why only amma significant part development took place under dmk too basically this info graph useless ,-1
there namo amma just nammaamma ,0
 don mind jaya problem she isn the one leading national coalition the chances her ever heading union government are close nil even the third front experiment succeeds against all odds way will mayawati mulayam mamata nitish etc set aside their own egos serve under amma say something about her not really showing the kind vision modi has economy infrastructure industrialization etc but the above will suffice she simply not going make ,1
wasn twain who said lies damned lies and statistics there popular joke which goes wife made millionaire used billionaire information such this gives you idea progress and development what you want see trend set trends truly understand where you are headed this gives you idea whether amma has made life better for her state namo has made life better for his dig deeper there are citations the sources information meaning don know the data trustworthy there explanation the calculation the data either all all very well created and absolutely useless information you really think about but really well sold ,1

this the problem with statistics the answers depend the questions asked modi supporters use the statistics modi favour but there entirely different seemingly objective picture available always ,1
didn start off with bigger base development than gujarat plus chennai ,-1
point the way very important less fertility rate and less infant mortality rate both are very important and good example social development ,1
 glad that are finally comparing politicians development rather than other tertiary fish market arguments looking officials data shows that gujrat not doing any better than the other top states none the less gujrat among the top which good think the vibe created that gujrat magnitude times better than other states extrapolation definitely doing better than most states but other states cannot ignored which are doing equally well this infographics gives some incite that ,1
ideally modi should marry amma and they both can pms guess the state that their progeny will rule will the most prosperous the world ,1
 can believe people aren even considering the reason these guys were willing wag their mouths the guy who made this video apparently promised compile their heroic deeds and report higher ups some hindu samaj get them handsomely rewarded now too hard imagine why one would eager reveal one criminal actions before complete strangers can believe the naivete this thread ,1
what our other choice ,-1
the amount muslim haters this sub too damn high ,1
this the reasoning have mind regarding post godhra riots modi did indeed order the genocide and protect the perpetrators did not order the genocide but actively allowed happen and protected the perpetrators did not want happen tried stop but couldn however after the incidents defended the perpetrators did not want happen tried stop the best his ability but couldn actively pursued many convictions possible after the incidents and are brainers there should doubt anyone mind that such person should not become the also not positive because the fact remains that could not stop people from dying with whatever control had but indeed true would give him the benefit the doubt because his track record wrt development since the riots but the unapologetic tone disrespect towards the media aggressive rss support convince that very unlikely that true hence modi not the right person lead the country especially with many other able leaders found even within the bjp edit grammar,1
 not time leave all this think about progress like removing the veils burkhas secularism and move towards first world india leave the evidence courts tell your congress bosses matter what you modi will the india post may 16th 2014 ,1

 posted yesterday about using bayes theorem inform the search for mh370 and got some really useful comments been thinking about the statistics this case lot recently could someone help confirm refute the following logic let assume that with such vast sar effort coupled with what emerging shortage satellite imagery from various sources that the probability finding mh370 debris any given day the sar effort that passes the smell test the sar effort has gone the correct location for say days earnest wouldn that imply the probability finding debris that period time and increase the days the search has been going include the continual sat image review going behind the scenes the probability finding confirmed debris those days would something just doesn feel right about the fact that they haven found anything yet let have mature discussion about this edit just thought experiment what give the sar crew the benefit the doubt and say the per day independent probability finding wreckage and let assume this thing goes for another days with verified leads debris that case something would really fishy chance should have found that hypothetical scenario edit made this sensitivity table help visualize the effect changing the input parameters ,1

the new search area very close diamantina deep considering how quickly the entire search force abandoned the previous location and that fact that the fbi was set have completed their analysis the captain hard drive they found diamantina deep his internet search history would both the kind credible evidence that causes complete shift search area but also something you absolutely could not release the public until confirmed with wreckage thoughts ,1

here good graphic which have way verifying not sure already been posted not haven seen before shows overlay australia radar coverage and the last ping derived arc location the plane the arc goes straight through the satellite system which think already knew before someone highly motivated and with inordinate amounts free time could and stick there the various search areas and debris sightings that would super cool australia refuses confirm deny whether the plane was detected well according the trustworthy media but think either their system was down malfunctioned and they don want anyone know they did detect the airspace and are using that direct the search areas and are keeping secret for who knows why and need the doppler effect only cause cool either way can imagine that they did detect but are refusing use the info release other investigative agencies they spending boatloads money searching for this plane too and doesn make sense for them continue spending what they know incorrect also the plane was detected why would they keep that secret not like their satellite capabilities are secret don think this case the plane flying under the radar think this radar goes pretty low would have wasted enormous amount fuel and the pings probably would have cut off lot sooner think there good chance the plane passed through this region and wasn detected for whatever reason jpg,1
question possible the plane was programmed just before 000 fly that way until ran out gas and everybody board was dead ,1

the elephant the room that more than likely none the debris that the satellites picked were wreckage from mh370 remember either hearing the news reading article about how ocean currents that part the world often bring together all the stuff ocean has collected over the years bystander and already felt hopeless and frustrated can only imagine how the families and search rescue team feel ,-1
 the new analysis that the plane flew faster burned more fuel and travelled less distance these factors would lead less flight time but time air the most concrete fact the ping data confirms these points faster burned more fuel and travelled less distance work with the fact the plane must also the air for hours ,1
 confused they are saying the plane was traveling faster than they thought more fuel was being used traveled shorter distance but they have pings all the way assuming the plane had not yet crashed until least that moment which would have stopped the pinging there concrete amount time had the air how could travel less distance when was traveling faster for the same amount time are they saying that they overestimated whatever time after the plane was the air which would have had less than hour and that compensates for the decreased distance ,-1
considering that the current search area takes hours get hours search and hours return for the hours flying time think everyone should thank their lucky stars that the new search area turned out 684 miles the northeast the current search area toward australia turned out 684 miles the opposite way the planes would have had nearly zero time the target search area before they had turn back fuel ,1

expert organisations analyse available data and determine the best area search the key pieces information being analysed relate early positional information from the aircraft and
later polling satellite aircraft system the new information based continuing analysis radar data between the south china sea and the
strait malacca before radar contact was lost indicated the plane was travelling faster than previously estimated resulting increased fuel usage
and reducing the possible distance travelled south into the indian ocean the international investigative team supporting the search continues their analysis which could still
result further refinement the potential flight path this has been combined with information about the likely performance the aircraft‚Äîsuch speed
and fuel consumption for example‚Äî arrive the best assessment the area which the aircraft likely have entered the water the information provided the international investigative team the most credible lead currently
have the search aircraft wreckage however this information needs continually adjusted for the length time elapsed since the
aircraft went missing and the likely drift any wreckage floating the ocean surface finally let stress that under international convention malaysia has investigative responsibility for
malaysia airlines flight mh370 this stage the atsb‚Äô main task assist the search for the
aircraft this day the search for the aircraft‚Ä¶ have drifted the area for days movement taking into account the actual weather and known currents atsb spokesman unsure what the actual speed was the assumption that the aircraft was travelling somewhat constant speed data from satellite polling and radar matches satellite imagery may may not objects and may not debris fields previous search areas have now been abandoned could debris wind scattered around the world depending who picks ‚Äì under international convention remains the responsibility the country where the aircraft was registered any wreckage which picked will held for the malaysian investigative teams atsb operating behalf the malaysians any debris picked must handed over australian authorities new area will help get more aircraft scene for longer the other benefit the search area longer the roaring 40s ‚Äì which means better weather conditions more often debris has been seen the old search areas does not want classify satellite and visual spots those areas debris that just not justifiable with what have seen adds that this kind thing not unusual this the normal business search and rescue operations the new area based refined data possible that further analysis may change that again what are you actually refining the relationship between 777 performance satellite pings and various projections versus that information trying find the right coincidence those and the end point when the aircraft runs out fuel all engines die together there are range scenarios you still believe the course changed several times the best assessment the aircraft headed south consistently into the indian ocean are you looking other leads from the malaysian investigation the two primary methods are the analyses the movement the aircraft that the best information can have satellite imagery being followed but has produced sightings sophisticated oceanographic modelling determine drifts recall please that this days after the event was expected happen over that days there‚Äô significant amount random dispersion objects the search area gets significantly bigger over time data marker buoys are being distributed into new search area continue model drift and keep search area confined all data currently available has been made available the search ",1
here another hammer their quickness abandon the search area based this new data analysis plane speed means they have literally zero confidence any satellite images they have released over the last week does this means satellite imagery just not good enough useful this search all find this hard believe but with this current abandonment all can conclude that there ton floating garbage debris the indian ocean and satellites not able distinguish these pieces well enough this may truly impossible cause folks ,-1

india for indians only,0
hmm think the whole against illegal immigration and wants illegal immigrants sent back but wherever hindus are the minority and are being persecuted bjp wants them move india seeing india the only hindu majority nation this world tried arguing against this logic pointing out that there are already millions hungry uncared for indians who should looked after first rather than foreign national just because she hindu being persecuted have responsibility neighbor urge bangladesh protect minorities but beyond that against this notion should deport all illegal immigrants irrespective their religion grant them asylum needed case case basis ,-1
 take jab persons migrating legally should welcome all states should accommodate them infiltrators who enter the country illegally need tackled they tend disturb the regional functioning removed religious subtext less controversial interpretation ,1
very good ,1
this allowance refuge the base religion actually valid india was divided india east and west pakistan remember what basis religion bangladesh very much islamist state recognized hindus are seeking refuge due persecution they should allowed however muslims are crossing borders huge numbers than becomes whole new issue which would require diplomatic intervention ,1
old issue rehashed several time here modi wants india give asylum bangladeshi hindu refugees who came here escape persecution and growing islamic radicalism their home country increasingly common problem bangladesh but not bangladeshi illegal migrants general who just came here for economic opportunities because their numbers are simply massive and are causing major demographic changes several indian states ,-1
what wrong with that another lame ass attempt modi bow wow ,-1
 you know what are you comparing refugee status some people anti national scam awarding citizenship status some people think about and let know what you think ,0
 have answered this several times tldr whole heartedly agree persecuted hindus don have any other place earth except probably nepal somebody must help them ,1
 don need more poor people india are already nation with large scale unemployment and poverty why are allowing immigration people with little skills the reason why bjp wants pursue this create voting loyalists for the party congress has allowed unfettered immigration people belonging particular religion just increase its voter base ,-1
same they think this ,0
there are two categories illegal migrants first are those who want come india for economic reasons secondly those who are persecuted should provide asylum those who are persecuted and send back those who came here for economic reasons support modi stand this ,1
modi communalist the little fucker knows bangladeshi hindus are not facing any problems india but has play saviour role which had done gujrat for more than decade pakistani hindus are crossing border rajastan and they are welcomed and are given out ration cards bjp each individual welcomed with celebration ,1
what sickulars say about this live bangladesh for some years bangladesh secular isn ,1
why only bangladesh hindu and christains from pakistan are killed raped and murdered even secularist should accept them plus according these countries are hindustan why not support him ,-1
why does everyone assume those here further votebank agenda politics are only muslim all you are communal,0
here take india was partitioned belief that muslims living india will continue live unharmed similarly hindus living west east pakistans will continue live unharmed india will considered hindu nation where hindus migrating from west east pakistan will welcome take refuge muslims from india are free migrate pakistan now that hindus are not being treated well and they want migrate nation which was created for them they are welcome but muslims have their nation result partition they are not happy with situation there then they should try improve situation rather than move across border not question about hindu muslim question national resources national security and rights indian citizens hindus bangladesh are much minority that you will not notice they migrate india but muslims are migrating much population that has created severe identity crisis east india and pakistan with support china trying take full advantage that situation think beyond your hatered for modi and put india before anything else you will realize are critical situation with major threat from pakistan and china and have handle favor india without giving communal color ,1

 seriously wish somebody would tell what this ravish kumar trying say here that parties play caste politics that what fetches votes that moneyed interests support parties they support sin crime have money and support party your choice now right reserved only for the poor leaders cant wan raise stuff like poverty and retire expensive hotel why they need prove their aam nature sleeping the road mind you not critisicing supporting any one party here this all the reality india today and the people have gone large extent contribute tthis have you ever wondered why the south india has grown much faster clip because while caste important especially karnataka not hesitate vote outside caste norms are not satisfied with the governance the ruling party this why despite all the corruption here still leagues ahead laloo because knows cant sit his hands for years and ask for votes the name caste heck jaya brahmin and she wins landslide victories caste pox indian society even more north indian central indian states and that the absolute reality ,1
 have read extensively this election and sorry say that ravish kumar being partisan and giving one sided view here afraid will not surprised joins the aap soon like many other journalists ravish kumar talks caste politics and candidates being fielded the basis caste but acts like this exclusive bjp and congress which party does not field candidates caste and religion especially and bihar even aap has been doing the same thing many constituencies many their candidates many states are fielded according caste calculations vip candidates aap succumbs cong bjp ailments 1427157 html ravish kumar acts businessmen hotels have something with the elections are they campaigning for modi has seen them distributing pamphlets money even the businessman who publishing bal narendra comics has said only doing because wanted something that would sell not distributing free campaign material plus few tens thousands comics are completely insignificant voters national level the children who read them will not vote anyway and general ravish seems very disgusted their prescence why have private businessmen suddenly become evil ravish employer falls the same category and many the aap and bsp politicians seems rooting for are also big businessmen like sanyal balakrishnan etc ravish observes that aap and bsp politicians not use expensive hotels while others while simplicity admirable does not have any bearing politician skills administrator the left and tmc politicians west bengal and the communists kerala are known for their relative simplicity and modest lifestyles but they are otherwise very thuggish and have not delivered good governance for their states least for west bengal ravish should look relevant things like manifestos promises track records etc ,1

 sad that every reporter who claims non partisan infact doing the bidding political party this was effort appeal the hindi speaking masses and love the construction but not the content how easily has bjp been accused indulging caste politics but there has been really been mention congress demanding all secular muslim votes the author failed mention that calling muslims secular all hindus are being labeled communal how easily has been forgotten that senior leader from aap demanded that muslims communal and the statement was later ratified the party the bjp has been accused putting star hotels but expenditure hoards aap workers being ferried air have been conveniently overlooked one cannot trust any form media person all everyone has make their own mind ,1
 would only like say war everything fair every party plays caste politics mean every ticket given the basis complex calculation what can you about this exactly what prompted selfpost how remove caste system that can come out this shit ,1
ravish far the best news reporter india his elections coverage has been exceptional and really both its freewheeling honest form and content unlike anything have ever seen life also seems the only one who can see through the absolute farce contemporary media their own sense exaggerated self importance really wish his prime time election coverage will win some sort award for outstanding journalism also great translation man thanks all the effort don disheartened the louts here who seem hogging the space with their inane posts need more posts like this edit ‡§ø‡•ç ‡§ø‡§æ‡•á ‡§æ‡§æ ‡•Ä ‡•ç‡§æ ‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§ï‡§∞‡§§‡§æ ‡§æ‡•á ‡§æ‡§æ ‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§∞‡§§‡§æ ‡•à ‡•§ never knew ‡•ç‡§æ could used verb also ‡•Ç‡§ø‡§æ ‡•Å translates bhumihar dominated ,1

 appreciate sentiments especially when call for moderating behavior that said this election was way about aap aap continues the same line will lost oblivion within yrs deservedly the way left the entire corruption plank all out against sm1 who prolly the best leader have was not just stupid but unforgivable also think presumptuous assume that there tommorow aap india has resurged from far worse times thinking that only select band people can lead salvation horrible idea the same way congress led believe tht they were the only ones who freed india ,-1
 don get all this aap small party some people here and look back their post history and check how many threads they have started criticizing aap aap small and inconsequential why the fuck are you people giving much attention you expect better subredit good luck with that the only thing that might change that the paid downvoters might disappear think they already have ,1
now that the results that they probably wont even open the account dawning aap supporters they are resorting the but got the moral victory route saw that twitter seeing here you might genuine but sorry the general experience dealing with the aap walas had made many man cynical some points aap not even strong regional party let alone national party let alone party replacing the congress mon party that many doubt will even open the account already your mind replacing congress maybe sometime the next decade but not now not even 2019 dont know what you mean aap revolutionized this election didnt see aap campaign anywhere except few pockets delhi amethi varanasi and few seats punjab compared the modi bjp blitzkrieg there comparison like not this election was about one and only man modi india against corruption was delhi movement not national movement attributing what was pan national phenomena cutting across rural urban divide high turnout delhi based movement sheer madness people are just getting more and more politically aware and the penetration internet rural areas and dedicated booth level management major parties the main reason for increased turnout aap ridiculed because its impatience nautanki hypocrisy inexperience above all the nauseating self righteousness when they are actually cut from the same cloth the rest same caste religion and criminal politics dont argue this enough links have been posted with aap politicians indulging all these except few brainwashed and few idealists one actually buys the crap that aap trying cleanse politics mean when someone says wants clean politics and then takes tacit support from goons like mukthar ansari bsp etc you know they are just shitting had not accepted all poltiicians are corrupt that all institutions are damaged beyond repair and need kranti things need changed from inside constant small manner and not the jaldi badlegas which will only result egypt like chaos perhaps aap actually wants this not sure for under years need party that fuels hope focus capital building infrastructure development improving job market improving economy general providing decisive and efficient governance bjp the party for that and hence the overwhelming support for amongst this demographic years later once modi retires need not worry since bjp has awesome bench strenght and talks are already start grooming manohar parrikkar take over from modi need genuine secular left wing party play perfect complement right wing bjp inc occupies that position now aap had chance develop into sensible left wing party but their actions betray deep inexperience arrogance nauseating self righteousness and incompetence they have all but squandered the goodwill they generated lot and nothing short miracle can save them unless they change their current ways hope they sink into political oblivion because the nation cant afford second congress winning matters but less joy able against weak opponents winning what matters not the opponents realpolitik suggests the weaker the opponents the better ,1

for bjp absolutey not let paraphrase person you must dislike lot modi arnab interview said stuff said the heat the election campaign momentary run nation need the assistance every single party every single politics involves the art give and take negotiation and even the shitty congress stood firmly behind the nda when came pokhran 814 the flight kandahar the nda backed the congress some bills aap will not that they are immature and think any give and take the sign corruption and collusion aap will make for shitty opposition shittier ruling party and maybe fit only dharnas and make wild allegations none which will ever taken forward proven like the discoms ambani swiss bank accounts the hundred other baseless allegations they have made winning matters but less joy able against weak opponents most knew time has came for congress either change die forever aap has risen become worthy opponent don believe these poll results for aap just ridiculous that even after delhi mistake they under estimate aap wrong electoral politics only winning counts and what this ridicuolous logic you guys have convinced yourself about the congress not dying did not die did not die 2004 will still the second largest party will still rule odd major states this country will still command minimum vote share nationally can summon allies deadlock parliament needs has money has power has connections has pull the media you think congress dying you are absolutely wrong wait for aap shatter over the next years that bound happen but congress will remain wouldn even surprised pappu mrs vadra came power either 2019 2024 the least upa coming back power aap supporters are naive leaders when comes real politik atleast the way leaders potray themselves also delhi 2013 not the rest india heck delhi 2014 not delhi 2013 mark words again this aap will the second largest party with about seats the delhi assembly 2014 for jlp they will end losing everything state centre and goodwill the people thinking about this scenario with eye future see bad times why party getting much ridiculed for cleaning politics what load rubbish what cleaning parties aap did the following subsidy raj hooliganism only smaller reach they are smaller party endless political drama the cost governance what the difference between mamta not doing anything bengal and claiming moist conspiracy and ak49 doing nothing and claiming the bjp ambani hand behind their absolute non performance associating with absolute communal muslims like taufeeq raza guy who ordered taslima beheaded jamiat islami hind the name being secular aap saar the exact replica the congress bsp tmc they have huge corruption scams their name yet did tmc have the taint scams till took power give time the average aap neta will also very similar the average political goon why you people have forgotten inc they are responsible that are where were yrs back like that india will not like where maya and mulayam romance people alternately lmao truly lmao aap forgot inc real life where ak49 has not mentioned the name rajmata her brood even once publicly except when last minute added her name his list corrupt even these forums which amount nothing irl have seen this behaviour aap aap leaders and followers who skewed the debate away from inc and failures into making some mission stop one man who the least corrupt big margin amongst leaders india today anything aap had virulently campaigned amongst support base small group educated urban indians against the inc the approx vote share would have also come the bjp and might have resulted lesser seats the inc and maybe maybe truly weakend that party but nope you guys had skew the debate away from your handlers ak49 janpath agree wholeheartedly with you the rest your post about keeping clean clarify this post not addressed you individually but the larger superset aap followers here mean offense you and post has hurt you any way please accept apologies lastly still think the exit polls are absolutely horrendously over bloated towards the nda and the nda crowning not certain and aap feel will get seats and not back empty handed fingers crossed ninja edit typos spelling mistakes etc long post didn truly clean all that said surprised you left out bjp and modi efforts rallying the masses that man accomplished some herculean stuff according the latest india today report has directly participated some 500 speeches been part holograms chai charcha etc some 000 has travelled some 000 and apparently met reached out the total bloody electorate you might dislike him you might hate him but you might want respect him his professionalism single minded focus and absolute bloodymindedness the face opposition from almost all other parties across india and about the sucession plans premature though they may the bjp for all the faults non bjp supporters find with truly democratic meritocratic party and the distant future get parikkar chouhan would say they are arguably the best this country lead aside from amma but meh her corruption and arrogance will come her way ,1
agree with you some parts hope aap becomes larger and mature party the coming years but they need acknowledge learn from their mistakes start respect and admire the good work done others aap should also project same image they give impression that only they are the saviours ,1
 local government deals operational level example municipal corporation union government deals strategic policy level aap perfect for local level but their policies are too socialistic and backward for developing country should they develop superior vision will support them primary concern economy and education believe the more educated our country the better leaders will have will support aap city level every single day but they need mature and gain depth for the national level ,1

you sound genuine but let give you simple answer aap not national party just fighting elections from all the seats from india doesn make you national party you actually need win them and for that you need have structure place may next decade think even bsp once fought elections from lot seats india still considered regional party well kind but you get the point ,1

bjp let alone nda has clear majority with wide margin fully expect them fast track all the good work and make some drastic changes this five years that will establish their ground for next years anything short this would disappointing would not have such expectations they had barely formed coalition majority ,1
 few other anti muslim innuendos few clearly you haven been following india for the past few months don think there anything worry about though mean what the worst that can happen modi the bjp can anything that goes against the constitution the court judgements even comes ram mandir issue ,-1
hope they sideline issues like ban beef export cow slaughter ram mandir asylum for non indian hindus etc uniform civil code good thing though also let see what they will about the much talked about black money swiss banks direct income tax reforms measures prevent corruption police reforms judicial reforms foreign policy changes curbing illegal immigration failing act not option coz the end the term they won have any excuse they have majority their own don have worry about the coalition dharma bullshit also free from the influence jaya maya mamata ,1
this precisely why was afraid the bjp coming into power don care about 2002 but would very pissed the state becomes embroiled religion some has already happened with this thrust promoting indian values whatever the hell they might please give development and economic freedom don thrust religion culture down our throats you let the people decide who put power not let the people decide what they want read what they want watch and what values they want adopt ,1
need absolute focus development supporting farmers and industries cultural imperialism hindu values ban valentine day nonsense regulations women working late these are all issues which will the critical eye with which should watching our government ,1

 totally agree the bjp party have heard have promoted religious advancement whether purposely accident instead fixing india social reforms and poverty stricken lands believe the bjp nationalist view the right view towards aiding the country benefit the people and social development not the economy lets just hope that modi will focus less his religious aspects india and more the country health have also considered the samajwdi party for their socialist views equal india with healthcare welfare and working rights for all will surely benefit the country but looks like they are not having too much recognition but please want hear more from the people who are actually being affected this election just interested student from the states,1
lets not ak49 this new govt give years and comment ,1
dae find amusing that the same comment the top comment and the bottom comment this thread wtf going here facepalm ,1
let him make government lets see who his cabinet people were worried about all those elements before and after elections gujarat and before loksabha election bjp not even governing the the states india wants win 2019 wants get some seats and increased his voteshares kerala and will worried doesn any development work promised and wins 2019 then will back hindutva most voted for modi bjp not modi supporters 180 million indian voted for him pretty sure there are more than hard core criminals voted for modi rahul doesn mean modi rahul criminal too ,1
 religious things include ucc 370 and illegal immigration then they should certainly they can prioritize development over but they should deliver their manifesto what with people claiming they shouldn the things they stood for and got votes isn this why hate politicians that they discard their agendas and manifestos after voting certainly think they should everything that they promised long tune with the constitution they should also not things that are the polar opposite what they said they said sabka saath and sabka vikas and they should live its spirit being pluralistic also ,-1

 can really understand why keep getting these submissions from what appear first time voters rss the ideological mentor the bjp both abv and namo were former pracharaks rss has influenced and shaped the way they and most their would ministers think why should the bjp disown its ideology just please section the college going first job junta the voted for modi but not cool with the rss bjp better stay away from them else vote will aap next time crowd while one wants modi give any importance the lunatics the sangh parivar expecting him the bjp stay away from their ideological mentor stupid voting for the left and making submissions about karat staying away from socialism the bjp has put emphasis development and that where their focus should but issues like the ram mandir should way forgotten just because handful first time voters want edit don forget construction ram temple also part pre poll promise and lot people would want see that happen not because don have enough temples india but because will the logical conclusion the movement that for the first time asserted hindu nationalism the temple about restoring the lost pride not very different from construction somnath temple post independence the razing the mosque was sad event but when plea hundred years falls deaf ears frenzy takes over ,1
